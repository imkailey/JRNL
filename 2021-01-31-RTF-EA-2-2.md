### What is the meaning beyond the surface? How do ideologies, values, and beliefs get wrapped up in this media artifact?

its trying to make owning a sony walkman seem like it will change your life, and that nothing will be the same after you buy this cassette player. it seems to capitalise on that fear people have of missing out on things that are culturally or personally significant. 

### Are certain identities invisible, shown to be passive and others active, presented in a negative light, or presented in a stereotypical way? 

I don't think that they make many different identities seem invisible necessarily, but also now that I think about it there weren't any people of color prominently in the ad, but there were a few in the background I believe.

- we have issues with self expression and not knowing how we appear to others; communication is difficult and often things are implicit; sometimes you are full of yourself; you give yourself the benefit of the doubt most the time;  see ourselves as good and competent; being mentally disabled makes these communication things really hard so i like to make communication explicit more often than implicit

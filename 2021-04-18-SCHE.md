Iâ€™ve attached the core list I mentioned. Also, I realized that if you successfully test out of government sooner rather than later (i.e. before registering for Spring 2022), then you can take 6 hours in the summer and 12 hours in the fall and reach the 60 hours needed for upper-division by the end of fall as planned.

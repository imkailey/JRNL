### Take Home Essay 3 Question 1
1. Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017) and Rathbun et al. (2016) point to three key dimensions in foreign policy attitudes. 
When it comes to the United States’ understanding of foreign policy issues, there are two studies that help broaden our understanding and better analyze people’s stances on these issues. Gravelle’s and Rathbun’s studies both set out three primary dimensions through which to analyze foreign policy positions, those being militant internationalism, cooperative internationalism, and isolationism. I will be using this lens to analyze our current and former foreign policy stances here in the United States.

Please discuss which dimension you believe best reflects the current attitudes of Americans toward foreign policy. 
I believe that when it comes to current United States foreign policy, for the most part we fall under cooperative internationalism. My view generally comes from our use of NATO as a defensive alliance,  our use of trade agreements like NAFTA to bring countries together, and our recent stepping back on military conflicts. 

- What are some of the misconceptions of early American foreign policy?
  - isolationism
    - Strong emphasis on trade
  - have secretary of state and ambassadors as early presidents
The main misconception of early United States foreign policy is the belief that it was isolationist and without a central idea of what it wanted to do. This is primarily from a European perspective, as western Europe spent a lot of the early United States’ history fighting for military dominance over one another. The belief generally stems from the United States’ staying out of a lot of wars and conflicts in its early history. However, this belief fails to take into account any sort of trade policy or neutral foreign policy that can take place. 
Also, a lot of early u.s Presidents were involved in some sort of foreign affair office before becoming President, 13 out of the first 15 to be exact. If the u.s people weren’t interested in foreign affairs, they wouldnt elect so many foreign affairs politicians to the white house early on. 

- What are some of the critiques of American foreign policy attitudes and how are they linked to Converse’s study of American political attitudes?
  - not fixed ideological structures
  - found there was more structure than converse thought and more structure than Aldin thought
Often people talk about United States’ lack of a clear ideology when it comes to foreign policy, using Converse’s study of American political attitudes to back their opinions. 

- What role does globalization play in shaping the American economy?
  - can help with competition
  - Worldwide events can mess with prices
Globalization has broadly affected the United States in both foreign and domestic spheres. For the most part, it has been very positive, lowering costs on products and helping with innovation. However, where there are issues in one part of the world it will affect everyone. For example, the boat that got stuck in the Suez Canal caused goods to get delayed for weeks all across the world, when that is an even that only took place in one small area. 

- What are the factors that have influenced American attitudes towards globalization?
When it comes to people’s opinions on globalization, this is broadly affected by someone’s economic and social class. For the most part, people that are in more skilled positions with high education really like globalization, as it helps them the most. However, a lot of lower skilled and educated people don’t like globalization, as it can remove jobs from their area and lower their wages. Not all of the affects of globalization are negative for people in lower classes, as lower costs of goods help everyone, but the negatives often visibly affect them way more. 

- What is the most important factor in understanding how members of Congress have reacted to globalization
When it comes to congresspeople supporting globalization, the biggest factor that determines this isn’t party affiliation but instead their constituency. If they have a wealthier, higher educated constituency they tend to support globalization. If their constituency is less well educated and lower skilled, they tend to not support globalization.

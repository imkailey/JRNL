### Analysis Guidelines

- looking at jazz aesthetic; movement; color; etc.
- look at colored museum at how they used in the things we've learned about so far

---

### Reflection Paper
- do we have to refer to Black feminism in reflection paper?
  - one feminist and one performance concept
  - *Black Feminist Thought* has bulk of info needed fem
  - not everyone in this bridge called my back; not everyone is Black in it
  - there is a moment asks about Black fem specifically
  - you can find outside sources
- don't need to read the script

---

### Ensemble
- If everyone agrees; can meet in person
  - Don't have to
- Can ad text be in final text
  - Yes
  - Can't be recycled text
- Can ad text not be same as final
  - Yes
  - Don't have to stick to same topics
- Feminist strategies:
  - Polyphony
  - Non linearity
  - Multiple truths
  - Non hierarchical relationships
- If someone in ensemble isn't going to meetings/helping with video; let professor know
- Try not to go too far over ten min

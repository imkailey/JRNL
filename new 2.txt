### human evolution
- raymond dart
- how science worked
- australopithecus africanas
- bipedalism
  - main thing early hominoids
- goes thru family tree at end of lecture
- may have to write out taxonomic chart on exam
- 4 core hominid adaptations LIST
  1. bipedalism
  1. canine reduction
  2. megadonty 
  2. tool use
  3. striding
  4. symbolism, art, and culture
- early hominid adaptations LIST
  - look in book for early hominids
  - derived traits
  - habitual bipedalism 
  - thifkcer enamel
  - reduced canines
  - large molars relatively
- sahelanthropus tchadensis 7-6mya
- ardipithecus orrorin
- find rest in book 

### moving into australopithecines (11th)
- moving into australopithecines
- 2nd set of adaptations
  - tool use
  - megadonty 
- associated genera
  - australopithecus
  - kenyanthopus
  - paranthropus
- introduces us to imp things
- shows things that make them bipedal 
- earliest evidence of tool use
- first tool industry
- lomekwaian stone tool 3.3 mya lomekwi kenyanthopus
- mode 1: oldowan tool industry 2.5 mya 
  - toolkit
- australopithecus garhi
- talked about why became bipedal
  - isnt a great idea
  - requires a lot of costs
  - 2 hypotheses (go find!! write details!!)
    - endurance running
	- greater efficiency
- paranthropus

### start to get to homo
- ledi geraru earliest homo fossil we have 
  - need to pay attention to that fossil in the lecture
- introduces to two we need to know number of
  - KNM-ER 1470
  - KNM-ER 1813
  - originally thought to be a male and female of one species
  - Homo rudolfensis
  - Homo habilis
- early homo LIST
  - large brain size
  - small cheek teeth
  - orthognathic jaws
    - face becoming more vertical
  - mandible shape
- moving through time we get to Homo erectus 
  - some say some are Homo ergaster
  - modern stature
  - climbing adaptations gone
  - associates with the 3rd element: striding 
  - Homo erectus leaves africa 
  - mode 2 tools develop
  - control fire
- H. heidelbergensis
  - mode 3 tools 
  - levallois technique
  - shaped and cut off of a larger rock 

### different modes of tools 
- mode 1 tools 
  - oldowan tools 
  - hand held rock with a cutting face 
- mode 2 tools 
  - achulean tools 
  - worked on both sides
  - still hand held
  - worked on a lot more
- mode 3 tools
  - levallois technique
  - shaped and cut off of a larger rock 
  - then can tie them to a stick to make a spear
  - lighter and smaller

### misc
- neanderthals next
- talking about more modern humans 
- anatomically modern humans 
- modern human variation
- read thru lab readings

  - public opinion?
  - political engagement
  - political education

  - not a strong ideological lean
  - some scholars say it isnt quite as bad as many think
  - overuse of heuristics
    - GOD THING

- which one do you believe has the most credibility and 
  - overuse of heuristics
Oftentimes u.s citizens are maligned for being seen to have failed to be good members of a democratic republic. There’s a whole list of accusations, from an overuse of heuristics to not having a strong ideological leaning to not being highly engaged or attentive to politics. I believe the most grounded criticism out of all of the ones I’ve heard is the overuse of heuristics, and the least grounded I’ve seen is the lack of a coherent ideology. 
When looking at how many u.s citizens overuse heuristics, one of the easiest examples to see is the god strategy.[look up name] Even if a politician isn’t super religious, oftentimes before elections they will release campaign ads acting as though they are, or hinting at their devotion during debates. This is done because most of the u.s is Christian to some extent, and non religious people normally aren’t put off by the stunt. Being visibly religious helps to signal to your base that you are a good person, and a lot of people use devotion to Christianity as a barometer of who is a good person.

- which critique do you believe is most overblown? 
I believe the idea that most americans don’t have a coherent ideology to be really overblown. 

- How does the media’s use of the combative politics frame alleviate or exacerbate these problems?
  - the media only focusing on the fight to get legislation in and the fight between two sides instead of whats in the legislation or on people's agenda
  - eventually leaves people feeling defeted by the time things pass into law
  - how might that shape ppls willingness to engage 
    - exhausts people by the time things are passed and dont like the policyt as much bc of the fight


- How does the use of emotions in campaigning alleviate or exacerbate these problems?
  - in some respects a good campaign usinng xyz emotion can get around some of the exhaustion from combative poliktics
  - in some respects a campaign using xyz emtion can play into ocombative poliltics and get some results
  - ini some respects a campaign using xyz emotion can play into combative politics and only frustrate people more

  - if a campaign plays into fear and anxiety, it will get less of a response from people
  - if a campaign plays on anger, people will not process new information as well 

- How might government policies contribute to the difficulties of citizens fulfilling their democratic responsibilities?
  - laws put in place that make it harder for individuals to vote
    - same day registration
	- mail in voting 
	- ID
When it comes to political participation in the u.s, sometimes the government itself can step in and make it more difficult for people who are eligible to vote to get their ballot in the box. Often this is done through the institution of laws that require a specific kind of state ID to vote, but there are other ways the state can get in the way. Sometimes states will lower the number of places you can go to vote, which in turn makes it take longer to get to a polling station and increases lines. This can be targeted to certain areas to get certain types of people to vote less. States can also reduce the number of days for people to vote, stopping people who have busier schedules from voting as easily. 
However, not all of the things the state can do are negative. Doing the opposite of a lot of these things can help people to vote

- How would rational choice scholars, such as Anthony Downs, respond to these critics?
  - cost and energy and  time to get information is time that could be spent on something else
  - participation & voting 
    - participate too much 
	- makes sense for this

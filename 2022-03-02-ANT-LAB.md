## overview
- primate feeding strategies
- dental adaptations
- gastrointestinal adaptations
- diet as a niche axis
- lab exercise

## primate feeding strategies 
- depend on: 
  - minimum nutritional requiremnts
  - availability of foods in the environment
  - ability to acess nutrients within differnt foods 

- primate feeding stratgies reflect an attempt to acquire enough energy to meet their nutritional requiremtns
- macronutrients
  - protein
  - carbohydrates
  - fats/lipids
- micronutrients
  - vitamins
  - minerals
  - water

### protein 
- necessary for 
  - growth and maintenence
  - essential amino acids
- types
  - animal protein 
    - easy for body, difficult to acquire 
  - plant protein
    - hard for body, easy to require

### carbohydrates
- necessary for: 
  - energy 
- types: 
  - fruits
    - high in simple sugars when ripe
	- low in protein
	seasonally available
  - leaves
    - low in simple sugars
	- high in complex carbs 
	- amound of simple and complex carbs varies with age of leaf
	- difficult to digest
  - insects
    - low in simple sugars 
	- high in complex carbs 
	- difficult to catch

### nutritional requirements
- depend on body size

#### Jarman-Bell Principle
- small body: 
  - high metabolism
  - rare, high quality food 
  - small body -> small gut -> small volume of food at any given time
- large body: 
  - low metabolism 
  - abundant, low quality food 
  - large body -> large gut -> large volume food at any given time 

#### kay's threshold
- < 500g - eat easily accessible protein [e.g. insects]
- > 500g - difficult to access protein [e.g. leaves]

### food distribution and availability
- clumped
  - e.g. fruits 
  - good spatial memory
  - high energy and time investment
- ubiquitous
  - e.g. mature leaves 
  - adaptations for digestion
  - low energy investment 
- random 
  - e.g. insects 
  - adaptations for locating
- keep in mind these are stereotypes 

### accessing nutrients in food 
- depends on the structural properties of the food 
- fruits 
  - degree of ripeness
  - seed size 
- leaves
  - degree of maturity
  - leaves vs stems vs shoots
- insects 
  - grubs vs adult 

## dental adaptations
- dental morphology reflects dental function

- recall: types of teeth 
  - incisors
    - aid in ingestion of food
	- narrow vs wide
  - canines
    - size reflects social behavior
	- not diet 
  - premolars
    - aid in mastication of food 
  - molars
    - aid in mastication of food 
	- morphology depends on structural properties of the food 

### fruit 
- frugivory
- mesio - distally wide incisors 
  - adaptation for biting into fruits 
- molars with low, rounded cusps- "bunodont" molars 
  - adaptation for mashing

### leaf 
- folivory
- mesio - distally narrow incisors 
- molars with high, sharp shearing crests
  - adaptation for cutting through leaves 

### insect 
- insectivory or faunivory
- molar with high, sharp cusps 
  - adaptation for pircing insect exoskeleton
- well developed molar shearing crests
- some produce chitinase [enzyme for digesting chitin]

## gastrointestinal adaptation 
- gastrointestinal adaptations are required to digest certain food items
- for primates, adaptations are found in leaf eaters, or folivores

### folivores 
- specialized gut for microbial cellulose fermentation
  - multi chambered stomach [foregut fermentation - colobines like cows]
  - expanded hindgut [other folivores - e.g. sifaka like horses]
### food for thought
- chimpanzees engage in hunting, especially of red colobus monkeys
- food acquisition may drive evolution of cognitive function 
- to consider: 
  - sophisticated level of cooperation, communication
  - planning
## summary of dietary adaptations 

- frugivore
  - range of body sizes
  - wide incisors
  - bunodont molars 

- folivore 
  - large body size 
  - narrow incisors 
  - high, sharp shearing crests on molars
  - specialized gastrointestinal tract

- insectivore
  - small body size 
  - high, sharp cusps on molars 
  - high, sharp molar shearing crests

### intro

When it comes to transgender rights and protections in Texas, often times the state actively works against you. Whether it's trying to get your name changed or get hormone replacement therapy, Texas is a mixed bag heavily based on region. This has personally heavily affected me, being a trans girl from rural Texas. Often times this issue is ignored by organizations like school boards until they're directly confronted, and I think there should be some kind of framework in place in the state to help out the local governments with trangender issues. I don't think any sort of positive framework for schools is feasible right now, so I will focus on more medical issues. 

### para 1

In Texas, treatment options are really sporadic, and recently there has been pushes to make illegal any sort of medical transition for minors. This recently was put in an executive order from the governer, trying to make teachers and other government workers report to CPS if they get wind of any sort of medical transition in a minor. Going this route for this policy is really roundabout and an awful way of implimenting it. Even if you believe medical treatment for minors is a bad idea you don't enforce this on the parents, but instead the medical practitioners. I think enforcing this in this manner is the state way overstepping into the doctor patient relationship, and that as long as you are receiving federally approved medical attention the state shouldn't be stepping in. I think that the best way to get something on the books that solves this problem would be to propose state legislation to protect people's right to medical privacy. You could frame this in a way that could also help there not be a state mandate for vaccination as well. If you were unable to get support from state congresspeople, you could take this down to a county level potentially.

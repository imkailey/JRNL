1. what influencces the public news
- selective exposure
  - motivated selection of entertainment based off your beliefs
- partisanship exposure based off your politial beliefs
  - people typically pick places that confirm their beliefs
- do people prefer likeminded news?
  - may seek out partisan sources bc its what around
  - magazine study tried to find that out
    - table had magazines
    - person in lobby monitoring
    - partizanship influenced what they picked
2. why public make their choices
  - people find things against their view biased; whether or not it's partisan
    - if non partisan; two sides angy at each other
  - hostile media effect
    - seen as biased against us
3. what is the effect of the publics choices of media
  - relative hostile media effect
    - if its slighly leaning one way or other; people see it as heavily leaning one way or another
  - selective exposure = political polarization
    - also inspires political participation
    - leads people to think about different issues
4. what to do
  - diversify media exposure
    - look at things on both sides; talk with others; like going to gym
    - need to be charitable
    - argue with others in good faith

- has everything to do with more speech is how to counteract bad speech
  - very pertienet with social media
  - didnt take into account how much bad speech there is
  - currently this is contentious

- how do you cultivate a healthy marketplace

### marketplace ideas - competition
- part of theory behind looking at media ownership
  - as long as have competing ideas; often will be enough
  - but the marketplace (literal) constantly changing
  - current media companies own everything
  - very little diversity ownership ofin these places
    - we should keep an eye on this
    - often times diversity is limited by ownership

## 15 jul 1985 pg 5
### long on performances, short on polkitical context
- more nostalgic than revolutionary than woodstock
- very little black representation for an event giving to africa
- didnt really focus on the details of what was going on, first was virtue signaling
- current music environment didnt focus on the bigger picture, who was influenced by what and who influences what
- white washed representation of what rock was
- focused more on the spectacle of what was going on 
  - should have focused on how to get the aid there
  - should have shown more what it was going to
  - should have focused on more diversity
- woodstock used politics to help change the world
  - live aid thought if you throw enough moeny at a problem it will go away
- very very little focus on the actual cause raising money for
  - mostly a focus on changing the world and on the music
- mostly a cynical look at the whole event
  - from the perspective of someone whos a rock fan who feels pandered to in a bad way
  - focused on a lot of the criticism from within communities related to this

- transnational is now a part of the language of film
- question of "scale" central to film theory
  - global
  - national
  - regional
  - local
  - cinematic screen
  - tv
  - digital
  - mobile
  - etc.
  - now the scales are becoming more varied, not as much of hierarchy
<!--2008 Oscars clip-->
- How does film produce geopolitical imaginary of particular historical times and places?
- whom does the film address and from what geopolitical perspective
- what does a film accomplish as a narrative
  - what a film is has become broader
  - what film accomplishes in its narrative as relates to hose scales
- understood as simultaneous operation of multiple scales
  - not fixed, keep changing
- transnational not just something that's in addition to film, but an integral part of films
### disciplinary assumptions
- need to come up with new assumptions as a discipline

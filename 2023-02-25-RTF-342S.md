## typology of cinematic transnationalism
### experimental transnationalism
- a guiding assumption has been some forms of cinematic transnationalism have been more worthwhile bc they promote certain things we value highly
- experimental is good for this logic of experimentation is linked to this


# 2023-01-23-RTF-342S
- started by going thru the assignment from last time
  - I got 4/4
- definitions in slides of different transnationalisms

### contemporary Nordic transnationalism
- Nordic noir
- Scandinavian tv dramas

### transnational film theory
- transnational is now a part of the language of film
- question of "scale" central to film theory
  - global
  - national
  - regional
  - local
  - cinematic screen
  - tv
  - digital
  - mobile
  - etc.
  - now the scales are becoming more varied, not as much of hierarchy
<!--2008 Oscars clip-->
- How does film produce geopolitical imaginary of particular historical times and places?
- whom does the film address and from what geopolitical perspective
- what does a film accomplish as a narrative
  - what a film is has become broader
  - what film accomplishes in its narrative as relates to hose scales
- understood as simultaneous operation of multiple scales
  - not fixed, keep changing
- transnational not just something that's in addition to film, but an integral part of films

### disciplinary assumptions
- need to come up with new assumptions as a discipline


# 2023-01-25-RTF-342S
## disciplinary assumptions
- 20th century definitions of scale in globalization in film studies: global, national, local as distinct hierarchical  scales of organization
- "global" export of u.s and western European cinema to "national" and "local" cultures around the world
- evident in debates about Hollywood cinemas of the world
- now replaced by more dynamic understanding of globalization in the 21st century
  - as complex cultural exchanges between traditional centers and once peripheral now western locations

### decentered subjectivities, decentered capitalism
- international film history has always been key to globalization on multiple scales
- filmmakers always in dialogue with one another's work in dynamic cultural political contexts
- nonwestern audiences long had access to more than one national cinema; viewing practice understood as active negagement, not to be passive reception; changes in film industries and styles not merely in response to national pressures, but multiple, international determinants;"spatial turn" in film studies; 21st century film studies drawing from geographical theories of globalization; from scholars like michel foucalt and david harvey;  who reject top down models of globalization;  to explain how uneven relations of power are dispersed more horizontally across space; mapping horizontal relations of "decentered subjectivities and decentered capitalism"; capitalism once seen as geographically centered in the west;  now understood to be spacially dispersed across the globe;  subjects of capitalism once seen as western;new theories, new problems; how to map complex geographies of spatially dispersed global cinemas of the 21st century; john urm: concept of complex mobilities across multiple scales;"grids of intelligibility"; saskia sassan (globalization):;  global cities as hubs of capitalism;  not just one hub or place;  business and financial centers are global cities

## video games
<!-- came in late, look at slides-->
### 3 characteristics of storytelling in video games
- setting
  - how does mise en scene gunction in video games
- premise 
  - what is the purpose of the setting
  - how does it operate as a caralyst
- characters
  - player characters
    - set character
    - choosing/customising character
    - avatar
    - in this category, you often have many choices
      - however, you are constrained by the categories the developers make
  - cast character
  - functional character
  - avatar
  - cast character
    - a supporting character helping guide through the story
  - functional character
    - literally only serve one function
    - enemies like zombies
    - shopkeepers
  - stage character
    - filling up space normalize it
####2 mechanics
- branching narrative
  - sort of like choose own adventure
  - allows for more agency
  - is more of an illusion of free will 
  - sometimes can bottleneck you into a final option
<!--  - detroit: become human is a good example of this-->
<!-- remediation normally happens from video games borrowing from film, but can happen the other way around-->
- emergence
  - actualization of our choices based on what machine brings back to the game
  - when you make choices, ai will spit something back
- quests
  - games can last a long time
  - help us break everything down a bit to help you get some reward
  - help us to remain in a good space from beginning to end
#### 3 reception
- literary repertoire
  - depends on prior experinces to gameplay
    - developer
    - media franchise
    - genre
  - story level vs action level
    - story level: how the story presents who you are as character and the world around you
    - action level: learning through the gameplay about the world, mechanics, and things around you
<!--gotham knights looks cool; coop-->
##### gotham knights analysis
- character
  - cast characters: people calling in
  - function characters: enemies
  - stage characters: background npcs
  - mise en scene: takes place dark, crime ridden, violent, intense city 
    -  looks like arkham asylum to some extent
### interaction vs narrativve
- by definition games are interactive
- can be in conflict or contrast with cohesive narrative experinces
- games may or may not deliver both in perfect harmony
- can't be a whole cohesive experience if there's a lot of characters to play as
### narrative delivery
- out of game
  - things in pause menu, in game encyclopedia, hud, etc
- in game
  - interaction with things diegetically within the game
  - can include hud if its diegetic, can include things normally non diegetic
- external materials
  - things outside of the game completely 
    - guides, 
    - videos, 
    - wikis
- agency
  - idea youre in control of the game 
  - not necessarily true 
  - there are points where agency can be restricted
- immersion
  - the idea you are engulfed in the gameplay where you adopt the internal rules for some amount of time

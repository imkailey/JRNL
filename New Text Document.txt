anzaldua states that language and ethnic identity can be very much linked to one another
[i agree that the way language is used can be used to help form a community]
this is something we generally know on a personal level but isnt necessarily intelectualized before her
peoples understanding of the language they use and its cultural significance is a slippery thing to talk about
some people will use someones lack of skills in a language to attack their loyalty to their nationality, ethnicity, or culture
  this is dumb, many people do or dont speak languages for their own reasons

# 2020 10 23 RDME
### Welcome, I'm Kailey, and this is all of my notes starting from the fall semester of 2020. I'm an RTF major at UT, and this is not just my school notes, but pretty much everything I've written down since the start of the semester. It's mostly a public GitHub project because I want the ability to share it to myself and others without having to authorize it, and everything of my life is already on the internet so I don't really care. Have fun!

### Here's a key for all of the abbreviations I use at the very end of my file names:
- R = Reading
- N = Notes
- P = Professor
- M = Meeting
- L = Letter
- K = Key
- TD = Todo
- F = Full
- M = Misc
- E = Essay
- B = Budget
- C = Class
- FI = Future Ideas
- PA = Pleasure Activism
- O = Other
- FN = Film Notes
- CN = Character Notes
- R = Reflection
- F = Future
- I = Idea/Ideas
- WN = Watch Notes

Pitch Fest will be moving to Wednesday, August 10th due to several folks being OOO on the 26th.  HOWEVER, I would like you to submit your logline for your pitch THIS WEEK by Thursday, July 21st at 5p CT.  This way the partners can review the premise of your shows and if you need to make changes, you’ll have time to make the changes prior to Pitch Fest on August 10th (Pitch Fest presentations will be due to me by Monday, August 8th).

**Logline:**
A log line or logline is a brief summary of a television program, film, or book that states the central conflict of the story, often providing both a synopsis of the story's plot, and an emotional "hook" to stimulate interest. A one-sentence program summary in TV Guide is a log line. 

**Here’s an example from a show we’re pitching called Life on the Ropes:**
Pro wrestlers Matt Cardona and Brian Myers were at the top of the WWE mountaintop when COVID hit, and along with more than 100 other wrestlers, they were fired. Life on the Ropes is their comeback story -  chronicling Matt and Brian as they try to rebuild their lives and chart their own course by creating their own wrestling league.

**My Logline:**
Craft beer has grown as an industry throughout the U.S. as regulations on the creation and sale of alcohol have been laxed in different areas around the country. National Brewery Tour is a guided tour through America's craft breweries, highlighting the regional specialities of the different sections of the country.

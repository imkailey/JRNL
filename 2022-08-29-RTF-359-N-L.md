### this lecture focus
- broad
  - how does a cultural studies approach the study of media
- specific
  - how do we study women in sports media using a cultural studies lens

### defining culture
- culture: 
  - a human being is "an animal suspended in webs of significance" 
  - I take cultrure to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in the search of a law, but an interpretive one in search of meaning
- much of what we'll be doing in this class is taking in a lot of different types of information about the culture that creates the environment, that allows for women's sports to exist at all
- cultural studies is the lens we use to study women in sports media 

### cultural studies
- cultural studies:
  - an innovative interdisciplinary field of research and teaching that investigates the ways in which culture creates and transforms individual experiences, everyday life, social relations, and power

#### some characteristics
- adopts a multiculturalist politics
- examines relations of power in embedded media orgs, texts, and audiences
- examines how media as a tool to challenge power structures

#### ok cool, but how?
- isnt necessarily about the individual film, but look at the field as a whole
- find patterns across media texts that show broader cultural ideologies and deconstructs them
- shows a relationship between a media text or context and history, politics, and economidcs
- considers marginalization of identities in media

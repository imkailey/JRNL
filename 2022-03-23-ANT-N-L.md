## theory of mind?

### theory of mind
- hypothesis that individuals categorize and think about themselves and  others in terms of mental states
- alternative hypothesis is nonmentalistic -> individuals respond to or categorize and think about themselves and others in terms of observable properties of appearance and behavior

### theory of mind: tests?
1. imitation
2. self-recognition
3. social relationships
4. deception
- LIST QUESTION

## are primates smart?

### primates have big brains
- bigger animals have bigger brains
- not all primates
- not just primates

## why do primates have big brains and does that mean intelligence
- selection pressures for abilities to locate and harvest high quality foods
- need big brains
  - to remember where food is
  - if diet requires extracting resources from matrix in which they are embedded

### social hypothesis
- permanent social groups require tricky balance of competition and cooperation
- negotiation of relationships -> social complexity
- social complexity not automatic consequence of the number of individuals in group but function of range and subtlety of behavior expressed by its members
- brain size constrains size of social network:
  - constraint on memory for relationships
  - constraint on social skills to manage relationships

### language evolution - caution!
- must avoid tacit circularity
  - expansion of forms of communication that became language did not begin with humans who had minds adapted to language and in cultures adapted to language
  - children are *now* born into an environment saturated with language
- language built on cognitive and communicative skills already present in primate lineage
- comparative approach attempts to identify which skills could have served as building blocks for language

### language vs speech
- language: system of communication that uses abstract symbols to represent meaning
  - spoken
  - sign
  - written
- speech: the vocal sounds typically used by humans to convey language

### language precursor
- 3 main hypotheses for primate language precursor
  1. gestures
  2. facial expressions
  3. vocalizations
- are these mutually exclusive?

## multimodal communication
- nonlinguistic and nonverbal cues to adjust the message conveyed

### vocal precursor
- language built directly on vocal abilities of our ancestors -> comparative evidence
- primate calls can refer to external objects and events -> referential abilities
- primates use syntax (order) and reference (meaning) in calls but cant copy novel sounds -> anatomy

## human cultures are incredibly complex
- praise ourselves as distinct from other animals
- dogma: culture frees us from the natural world, whereas all the other creatures are influences by nature
- are we really that different? other species make buildings to live in and alter their environment

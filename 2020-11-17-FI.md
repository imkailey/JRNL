## shera introspection


I had a lot of my friends leave me at some point and also like move away and stuff like in the middle of high school and had a complete personality change and stopped being such an asshole and stopped repressing stuff, and I'm like a completely different person now; also now I'm a girl lol. I think that's why I relate to this too hard also my parents used to be abusive and surveillance and stuff; why I have did.

I've always had ADHD and GAD and also dysphoria, but I've used dissociation to avoid that until I realized I'm a girl.

my life was kinda fucked. I actually need to meet with a neurologist bc my therapist thinks I've been having seizures, but only in one part of my brain apparently.

adora has a need  to save a protect everyone due to a past of being the golden child and the one who needs to stand up and be perfect and do everyhitng alone. she seems to feel like she needs to be the one to do all of it.

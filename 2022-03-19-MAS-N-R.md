### a trip through the mind jail
- starts with him thinking back to his childhood neighborhood
  - doesnt exist anymore and is upset about that 
- starts to go through what he misses about it and what it was like
- community only getting tohether on 5 may/ 15 sept 
  - revolutionary tales of grandparents revolution
  - no one really listens or cares about that
  - speeches more ceremonial
- a lot of focus on sex even from a pretty young age
- moves on to sunday night jamaicas
  - sunday night parties for every occasion
  - like a church bazaar
  - a lot of the same things that i had at my bazaars as a kid
  - guadalupe church
- in el barrio 
- story about hearing la llarona
- focus on gang activity of young children and their art as well
  - getting older to like 13 
  - they steal small things from people
  - grafiti
  - cults?

#### my analysis
- looking bac to his childhood neighborhood that doesnt exist anymore (at least not how he remembers) because he isn't just trapped in actual jail but instead one of his own making
- giving a look at the good and the bad of his childhood, using a positive lens to look at some of the bad

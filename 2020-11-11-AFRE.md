Your paper should connect "The Colored Museum" to one feminist and one performance concept covered in class. It should respond to the questions:

• What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"?

• What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any?

• How does it illuminate the lives of Black women?

• How does its aesthetics and use of dramatic form relate with (or depart from) those covered in class?

Your paper should be proofread and well-argued. Draw on specific moments or elements from the performance to corroborate your claims and connect these to specific quotes from the readings.

<!-- What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"? -->
"The Colored Museum" was mostly about the historical and current experience of People of Color in the Unites States, with a focus on

<!-- 1 --> the links between slavery and Jim Crow laws on present day People of Color, and other racialised injustices in this country,

<!-- 2 --> how People of Color are currently treated and act in the Unites States today,

<!-- 3 --> and how People of Color are currently marginalized in the Unites States.

<!-- What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any? -->
<!-- these are the feminist strategies -->
<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
<!--  -->
tcm presented blk women as people, without necessarily playing into stereotypes, especially for that time in media history.

tcm tries to present the day to day lives of blk people, including women, in a light that I haven't really seen portrayed before.

<!-- this part is supposed to be about stuff like the jazz aesthetic, movement, color, etc -->
<!-- One feminist and one performance concept Black Feminist Thought has bulk of info needed fem not everyone in this bridge called my back; not everyone is Black in it there is a moment asks about Black fem specifically; you can find outside sources -->
<!-- these are the feminist strategies -->
<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
<!-- you need to go thru and make it to where you don't need the questions there for it to make sense -->
<!--  -->
well, to begin with this performance of tcm was a televised one, whereas most of the other media we've consumed for this class have been readings. however, the more substantial differences start to appear when you look a bit deeper at the material of the media.
<!--  -->
one of the bigger differences is the intended audience of tyhe works. most of the media weve consumed for tyhis class has been for a more academic audience, without that much of an intention to entertain. this work, however, has entertainment at the front of its list of things to do.
<!--  -->
I also love the performances throughout this work. from comedic to serious to everything in between, all of the actors nailed their roles i feel. i really felt the emotion from each actor, and i didnt have a moment where a performance fell flat. considering how emotionally intense some of the scenes are, i would expect someone would give a performance that wasnt the best, however i couldnt find a time where i laughed at an actor for not pulling off a performance.

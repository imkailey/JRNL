Your paper should connect "The Colored Museum" to one feminist and one performance concept covered in class. It should respond to the questions:

• What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"?

• What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any?

• How does it illuminate the lives of Black women?

• How does its aesthetics and use of dramatic form relate with (or depart from) those covered in class?

Your paper should be proofread and well-argued. Draw on specific moments or elements from the performance to corroborate your claims and connect these to specific quotes from the readings.

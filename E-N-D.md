### weekly recap
- topics
  - the yellow wallpaper
  - group assingment

#### yellow wallpaper
- woman trapped in a room and walls talk to her
  - someone drew connection to tangled movie
- mental health and confinement fucks with you
- my past and how i was confined and stuff;  more socially than literally
- This feels really similar to some things I've gone through. My parents denied me trans healthcare for almost a year and a half if not longer, and eventually staying in my parents house caused me anxiety to the point that I was seeing things. Don't worry, now my parents are way way better and understand the importance of mental healthcare along with trans healthcare now.

##### group assignment
- three quotes on how her relation to the wallpaper changes over the course of the work
- group 4 in the doc

- what trigger the worst of the dissociation
  - field of view narrows
  - less of an environmental awareness
  - loss of time
  - total loss of control

- what is causing constant dissociation
  - effects of it
    - field of view is narrow
    - dont have much of sense of smell
    - pretty bad enviromnemtal awareness
    - sounds less visceral
      - or worse actually lol
    - forgetting what is goin on
    - remembering i forgot what happened when i try to time track

### notes/inferences

- sounds smells and eyes might have things to do with seizure
  - if not finding triggers; defninitely concerning
  - feeling way better about things; dissociation not getting any better




### misc

- yo tell a fucking doctor about the eye shit lol
  - if comes out clear; maybe see nueorlogist

- what trigger the worst of the dissociation
  - field of view narrows
  - less of an environmental awareness
  - loss of time
  - total loss of control
- what is causing constant dissociation
  - effects of it
    - field of view is narrow
    - don't have much of sense of smell
    - pretty bad environmental awareness
    - sounds less visceral
      - or worse actually lol
    - forgetting what is goin on
    - remembering I forgot what happened when I try to time track
    - lack of sub vocalization

### notes/inferences
- sounds smells and eyes might have things to do with seizure
  - if not finding triggers; definitely concerning
  - feeling way better about things; dissociation not getting any better

### misc.
- yo tell a fucking doctor about the eye shit lol
  - if comes out clear; maybe see neurologist
- yo go see a numerologist pls thanks

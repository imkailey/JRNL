- cso is their first attempt at creating one;  makes more sense as to why using the old engine maybe
  - csns is the second cs game made by nexon aimed at an asian market
  - actually there was a cso2??

- cso 2 was based on css, and was released in 2012
  - was updated more in 2017, but shut down in 2018 due to poor performance

### [cso wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_Online)
- cso had a spin off that became csns 
- after it became popular enough it superceded the original and cso got shut down
- csns was the first version of cso to be published to steam

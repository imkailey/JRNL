When it comes to internet service providers, it's almost impossible to have a good number of options available. this is due to the cost of entry being massive to enter the market if you need to build all of the networking to people's houses to start up, and also that a lot of the existing infrastructure has been built or subsidized using public funds. Due to these factors, allowing an internet service provider to discriminate what websites you can go to when there's only one real ISP in your area gives you no option other than moving to remedy this issue. Since all of these factors make it almost impossible for competition to exist, we should have net neutrality continue to be in place.

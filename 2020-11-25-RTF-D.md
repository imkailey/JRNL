My question for you is, is there any media that you have rewatched (or relistened to, or replayed)? Some questions to consider: do you (or did you) do so for class, for pleasure, for work? Are you doing it for an express purpose, or just to experience the media? What was that experience like? Do you learn new things about the piece of media when you rewatch, and if so what things jump out? Do you watch things alone, or with friends and family? Do you watch it on the same platform, or have you bought it more than once?

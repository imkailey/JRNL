- supposed to have a few ideas today for the QA
- supposed to be able to sell the show
- can pitch 60 min feature doc
- not a filmic one but a tv one

---

- things want to consider:
  - access to the location
  - not necessarily a geographic location 
  - realistic access 
- what some favorite pitches
  - 
- what dont resonate
  - would you watch this
- make sure not seen it before
- great characters
  - follow doc make sure interesting 
  - think about how interesting characters need be
- standalone 2-4 hours of something
  - mystery drags out and unfolds 
  - if true crime gotta be pretty crazy 
  - some realistic access

---

- big interest in car and motorcycle shows again
- if the duck dynasty family owned car restoration business
- family businesses where the family is kind of comedic
- could look around bellville
- adjudicated cases with new and inventive bucket to throw cases in 
- cult things can be cool
  - need an angle on it
- can talk to david about stuff

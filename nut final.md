# nutrition final exam review
### overview
- dont just know the facts, know how things work together

  - should be 

### ch 10-11 
#### Vitamins
- Do not yield energy
  - Necessary for life functions
  - Grouped by solubility in water or fat
    - know which are which
	- there's a chart in slides (26/38)
  - Bioavailability: amount present in food differs from amount absorbed/used by body
    - sometimes, doesnt get absorbed by body
- Vitamin precursors: converted to active form in body
- Organic nature (C): easily destroyed by natural forces (e.g. heat)
- Excessive intakes can lead to toxicity – only certain vitamins
- Some vitamins act as coenzymes (especially B vitamins)
- Understand roles in the body, deficiency, toxicity, recommendations, food sources, and destruction for:
  - B vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, B6, folate, B12
  - Vitamin C
  - Vitamin A and beta-carotene
  - Vitamin D
  - Vitamin E
  - Vitamin K

  - Water losses, dehydration, and recommended intake

- Minerals:
  - Major vs trace
    - whats up with each 
  - Inorganic
    - Can’t be destroyed
	  - by things like heat 
    - Can leach out and be lost in cooking water
  - Variable absorption, transport, roles in body, and bioavailability

### ch 12-13

### questions 
- water soluble vitamins more bioavailable?
  - not necessarily, other aspects affect this
  - what kind of food, waht all eating, what time 
- is vitamin b12 considered precursor to folate
  - they need each other, not precursor, codependent 
- whats a precursor
  - inactive form only becomes active in metabolic reaction 
  - can be turned in to

### questions 
- lactation and breast feeding 
  - lactation: anatomimcal response to produce breast milk for feeding the kid 
  - breast feeding is the process of getting the kid on there and having them drink it
  - both are difficult, breast feeding can be harder even if can lactate
- when introduce complimentary foods 
  - dependent on the family and the kid

Vitamins
- Do not yield energy
  - Necessary for life functions
  - Grouped by solubility in water or fat
    - know which are which
	- there's a chart in slides (26/38)
  - Bioavailability: amount present in food differs from amount absorbed/used by body
    - sometimes, doesnt get absorbed by body
- Vitamin precursors: converted to active form in body
- Organic nature (C): easily destroyed by natural forces (e.g. heat)
- Excessive intakes can lead to toxicity – only certain vitamins
- Some vitamins act as coenzymes (especially B vitamins)

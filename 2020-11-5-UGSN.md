### statistics

#### hypothesis

- hypothesis = less than good explanation

- in order be scientific; hypothesis must be able to test and falsify.

- we dont prove things in science; we disprove them

- hypothesis v null hypothesis
  - hypo; statement can be proven false
  - null; no difference between groups

#### inferential stats

- rare event rule; is observation probability is really small; would reject idea just due to chance

- calculate how likely it is thingsare due to chance or polling error

- if probablility is high; likely null hypothesis true

##### p value stuff
- if p is .05 or lower; likely random chance
- if p is .05 or higher; 95% confidence in data

#### quantitative or qualitative data can be collected

### criticisms media imperialism thesis
- us cinema seen as corrupting authentic cultures of other national cinemas around the world
- National cinemas collectively defined as world cinema and seen as necessary counterpoints to commercialized Hollywood
- But Hollywood versus national cinemas is a problematic categorization
  - ignores hybridity of cultures and creates false dichotomy of pure authentic world vs global Hollywood
- transnational cinemas paradigm in the twenty first century replacing older Hollywood vs National cinemas model in response to shifts in global film cultures and industries
- Concept of transnational cinemas used to break down traditional geographic divisions of Hollywood vs National cinemas
- and to understand changing nature of global filmmaking and new challenges of cultural hybridity

### miller: Hollywood
- Hollywood undergoing major transformations due to transnational media flows but
  - Hollywood is still dominant at global box office
- new Cultural division of labor key to Hollywoods dominance
- Sustained by links between Hollywood and us government (“washwood”)
- example: massive us state subvention for Hollywood in both domestic and global markets
- And working with Silicon Valley in high tech projects sponsored by military industries (“silwood”)
- Example: audiences now more profitable as objects of surveillance rather than brokers of taste 

### new international division of cultural labor NICL

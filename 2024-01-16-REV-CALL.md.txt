# 2023-01-16-REV-CALL
- resetting the table for the semester
- long term projects and things to work on when things are going on
- one of the major changes is checking in with AJ and Joe instead of Dan or Anele
- if nothing specifically needed, work on longer term specific projects with just me 
- things would like to work on more
- working with more individual people face to face, starting with Joe 
- think about what would look like for an ideal project to work with 
- working on finishing the film and the process towards the end 
- lots of festivals that aren’t the big ones that are available all year round
- knowing where to target for different sessions for what want to learn
- walking through the office when back, knowing where things are and go
- list of things in notion will be adjusted
- I’ll be in charge of keeping the office in order and knowing where things go to some extent
- biggest goal is to be a clean and organized space
- putting protocols in place and be deputized to keep things organized and in place

### Review
- protocol for when Kailey comes in
- dm Joe and AJ to see what’s going on, checking the intern slack channel
- if aren’t things going on, will be able to go into ongoing project
- if anything comes up that’s interesting or curious about, be sure to ask
- another goal is to be on set and be DIT
- feel free to be the squeaky wheel

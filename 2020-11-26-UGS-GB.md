Blanton Required GEM

    Due Dec 7 by 11:59pm Points 25 Submitting a website url, a media recording, or a file upload Available Sep 6 at 12am - Dec 7 at 11:59pm 3 months

It is a requirement of all Signature courses that you visit two GEMS of UT Austin. These are institutions and spaces that are unique to us. You have one free-choice gem assignment here. The Blanton activity is a required GEM and you have two options for completion this year (both virtual).

We have been both talking about and practicing creativity this semester. Inquiry is ultimately a deeply creative process.  To play with a slightly different type of creative expression,   we are doing an activity that ties in with the Blanton Museum of Art.  (http://blantonmuseum.org (Links to an external site.)).

To fulfill this assignment, you will choose one of these Blanton challenges to participate in and create a Flipgrid video and submit to this assignment. You will look at the Blanton collection (either online (Links to an external site.) or in person if you prefer) a choose a work of art that you like and that fits one of the prompts below. Then re-create the piece you chose doing Art-Where-You-Are
 or the Blanton Bake-off (Link (Links to an external site.)). Once you have created the piece, make a FlipGrid Video showing an image of the original piece, your reproduction and describe how this piece of art fits the prompt.  This assignment is due by the last class day, but I encourage you to do it much sooner so your end of semester isn't as stressful.

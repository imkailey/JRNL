Season 3 episode 1 of black mirror demonstrates technological determinism by making the main character's social media rating such a huge part of her life. It's the thing that determines where she lives, what job she has, what friends she has, and even how she presents herself in public. After she meets with the social media coach to try to boost her score, she has a visible bump in her fakeness, but also clearly her anxiety as well. Her social media presence causes her to keep a mask on all the time; she exudes an aura of fake niceness when she's in the public eye. It's something we see her working on as well at different parts of the episode.

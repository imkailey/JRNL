- paintbrush analogy for the different levels of government such as state nation and City
- each type of government / level of government has a different size brush and a different amount of paint
- you can try to address big things with more localized government and you can make progress but that progress isn't as much as if you were doing it at a higher level of government with a larger brush
- larger levels of government can try to address smaller issues, but this can have adverse effects on different parts of the thing

- I'm starting to better understand the rap music that I grew up listening to as a teenager
- could talk about all of the different things and different racial groups I was regularly exposed to throughout my middle school high school and elementary School experience
- when I went to John Paul II I had a lot more experience with a white asian and Hispanic students as opposed to etc etc
- in Belleville there were a lot more white and Hispanic people and not that many black people
- how could this affect my understanding of black people and black culture along with the issues that face black people in America today?

In a 1999 retrospective New Yorker article about the ongoing relevance of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, John Lahr offers the following anecdote:

> willy loman is a saleseman, but we're  never told what product he lugs around in his two large sample cases. Once, a theatregoer buttonholed Miller and put the question tot him: 'What is he selling? You never say what he's  selling.' Miller quipped. 'Well, himself. That's who's in the valise' Miller adds, 'You sell yourself. you  sell the goods. You become the commodity.'

What does Miller mean when he characterizes Willy Loman as a figure who “sells himself”? How is Willy’s ability (or inability) to sell himself connected to his ultimate demise over the course of the play? In other words, how does Willy’s value diminish over the course of Death of a Salesman? What evidence is given for such devaluation? Select three moments from the play (in the form of three direct quotes) as the basis for your response. The examples used (e.g., the quotes selected) should reflect a TOTAL reading of the play (beginning, middle, and end).

Remember that the response should be 500-750 words in length, double-spaced, with 12-point font and 1-inch margins. Response Paper #5 is due on Thursday, April  29, 2021 by 5 PM.

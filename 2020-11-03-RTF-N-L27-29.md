## L27
### the New Hollywood
- can be used to describe a new set of filmmakers from 60s through the 70s; that's what will be talking about today
<!---->
<!--//~~**side note; she's also asked us to watch a lot of trailers along with this lecture**~~-->
<!---->
<!--//first will go thru general historical stuff about it; then a grab bag of the films-->

### film changes thru 60s and 70s
1. any remnants of the old studio system fell apart post-1948, when the Paramount decree happened
  - the studios as businesses have staying power, but they must change the way they operate
  - cant release films the same way
2. poor performance after *The Sound of Music* (1965)
3. increased reliance on "calculated blockbuster" (T. Schatz)
  - (will go into more next lecture)
4. loosening of Production Code

#### Jack Valenti
- leader of MPAA from 1966-2004
- officially ended production code (68)
  - replaces w/ age based ratings (68)
- He's a Texan
- the rating system is like the Legion of Decency’s old rating system
  - G rating for general audiences
  - M rating renamed a PG rating; parental guidance suggested
  - PG-13 rating; 1984 based on heart ripping scene *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* MPAA adds PG-13 rating
  - R rating; film restricted to adults unless w/ parent/guardian
  - X rating; restricted to only adults
  - NC-17; 1990 they retired x rating; replaced with NC-17; trademarked it
- they trademarked all of these except X rating; X rating becomes synonymous with porn
  - most newspapers wont advertise x rated movies

### back to timeline; New Hollywood
- most films were on a line graph from taboo-breaking auteurs and profitable
  - a lot of filmmakers used the new freedom from the removal of the production code to bring their new films to light and tell better stories
  - often independent were the auteur films
  - for the 70s; auteur films were profitable; found a place in Hollywood; not in 1980s

### Art and Artistry of New Hollywood Era
#### *Bonnie and Clyde*
- 1967
- directed by Arthur Penn
- anticipated trends of New Hollywood
- It tells the story of real-life Dust Bowl-era bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.
- felt connected to the anti-establishment values of the 1960s
- polarizing film that pushed the envelope by placing almost slapstick-style comedy scenes next to very grisly scenes of intense, unflinching violence

#### *Night of the Living Dead*
- George Romero
- 1968
- not a Hollywood film
- shoestring budget of just $114,000 and shot it outside Pittsburgh
- blends campy and jokey scenes with boundary-pushing horror

### Making Profits during the New Hollywood era
- New Hollywood era is a bunch of filmmakers combining the politics of the era with relaxed restrictions around what films can show on screen, in order to tell boundary-pushing stories that feel young, vibrant, and even a little bit dangerous
- this is kind of the start of selling directors as superstars in their own right
  - both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas make their debut in the New Hollywood era

### Difficulty of balance of art and profit
- art vs. profit aren’t really opposition to each other in the New Hollywood
  - you get some directors whose films remain much more on the art side of things, like Terrence Malick
  - you get some directors whose films are able to contain that newness in a way that makes it appealing beyond the youth market, like Stephen Spielberg.
  - in the middle, there’s a host of experiments in trying to find the right balance of newness and marketability.
-**the lesson from *Popeye***
  - Building a blockbuster—even with an A-list New Hollywood director and stars and studio money behind you—is far from guaranteed.  
  - Marrying New Hollywood with old Hollywood isn’t exactly like snapping puzzle pieces together.

### Influences on "New Hollywood"
#### Industrial Influences on "New Hollywood"
1. loss of tax incentives for new productions
1. Cable TV, TV movies, VCRs
1. film schools
  - serving kind of as gatekeeping from making it into the industry
  - very masculine environment
  - risk management
    - straight white guys tend to be a safer bet

#### Social and cultural Influences on "New Hollywood"
1. rise of shopping centers and multiplexes
1. waning interest in arthouse cinema
1. dissolution of counterculture and rise of Reagan-era values

## L28 - Building a Blockbuster
**key concepts**
- blockbuster
- Stephen Spielberg
- marketing
- high concept film

### Blockbuster
- Blockbuster = a popular and high-earning film, often meant to appeal to a wide audience
  - (origin of the term doesn’t have anything to do with block-booking)
  - actually based on 1940s terminology about a kind of bomb that could level a whole block

### *Jaws*
-  was released in 1975
- Classical Hollywood era, in the 1930s and 1940s, a studio’s profits came equally from a whole bunch of mid-budget films released throughout the year.
- “blockbuster syndrome.”
  - in the 50s, 60s (and especially into the 70s, 80s, and 90s). Studios began to rely on blockbusters, not smaller pictures, as the main source of their profits.
  - studios would likely topple if they stopped making blockbusters
  - it has become virtually impossible to distinguish a film’s aesthetic or narrative quality from its commercial imperatives.  
    - you can’t untangle them from their profit-driven motives

#### Key Players in *Jaws* Success
- director Stephen Spielberg.
  - young, just 27 yeas old when he makes this film
  - reasons take young director on big project
    - identity and credentials make the film industry feel like they’re a reasonable risk
    - Spielberg had a preexisting relationship with *Jaws* producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown
- Peter Benchley, who wrote the novel *Jaws* is based on, as well as the screenplay.

**Turning *Jaws* into a blockbuster required a five-part strategy that was outlined in a great article in *The Hollywood Reporter* published right around the film’s release in 1975.**

#### **That strategy can be boiled down into:**

**Step 1: Book**
 - Producers Zanuck and Brown bought the rights to Peter Benchley’s book before it was even published
- They started when the book came out
- They sent copies all over Hollywood

**Step 2: Buzz**
- creative team went to the Cannes Film Festival a year early, before the movie was even out
  - They promote it there, but they don’t enter it into the competition—no one gets to see it yet
  - press is always hovering around the film festival looking for stories
  - they used the festival and the trip to Europe to sell the *Jaws* book rights to international publishers, seeding international interest in the story
- The dual promotion of the book and the film project far in advance of its release helps create huge anticipation for the film

**Step 3. Promotion**
- created a television advertising campaign around the film
  - Films didn’t advertise on TV
- the team toured U.S. cities, doing press
- They also did late night shows, and secured a Time magazine cover story before the film came out.

**Step 4. Release**
- The release was originally planned for simultaneous release in 900-1000 theaters, which is a very wide release
  - this is a strategy usually used for exploitation films, salacious films, or bad films that can’t live up to their hype; the trick is to get it out everywhere so people go to see it…before word gets out that it’s a crummy movie.
- thinks the film is good enough to drive up demand organically.
- cut back the initial release to about 400 theaters
   - still pretty big
- Limiting that initial release helped to lengthen the theatrical window and increase demand, milking even more profit from the film.

**Step 5: Merch**
- they created a strong visual brand from the jump
- The film’s recognizable design aesthetic makes for great merchandising

**Star Wars**
- You see this strategy reflected a couple of years later, with *Star Wars*
  - released a couple of years later

#### Did it work?

- production and ad budget; $7 mil
- first film to make $100 mil
- makes $133mil us box office
- makes $193 mil in global releases
- highest grossing film until *star wars*
- **adjusted for inflation; *Jaws* make a little over 1 bil in profit

### High Concept
- A high-concept film relies on one simple idea—you can usually condense the description into a single sentence.

#### Scorsese

> I don’t see Marvel movies.  I tried, you know? But that’s not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”  

- Reading is about what he meant

## L 29 – Fandom & Cult Media
### Misc
- Today’s lecture is a little bit different, in that it’s conceptual rather than chronological.

<!--### Key Concepts-->
<!--  - fan (multiple definitions)-->
<!--  - fan studies-->
<!--  - interpretive community-->
<!--  - affirmation vs transformational fandom-->
<!--  - cult film-->
<!--  - cult television-->

### Fans
So, Longhorns fans, Metallica fans, One Direction fans: they’re all doing similar things.  They’re standing, they’re screaming, and they’re gesturing at live events.  But the social rules of each fan group, and the social meaning of each fan practice means that they might be perceived in different ways.


Being a fan can also look like collective grief.  Here’s a photo taken at the mural on Guadalupe, toward the south end of campus, that was painted by Austin musician Daniel Johnston.

- So, then, fan activities might be described as [ANIMATION]
  - affirmational
  - affective
  - emotional
  - transformational,
  - social,
  - participatory,
  - solitary,
  - political [ANIMATION]
  - several of these things at once,
  - none of these at all.
  - **The very earliest ideas about fandom weren’t necessarily positive**

#### multiple types of fans
- mostly; fans are people who socially organize around a piece of media
- **two main different types of fans**
  - *Affirmational* fan practices support the fan object—this is stuff like buying and wearing official merch, collecting, watching and sharing trailers, and learning trivia.
  - *Transformational* fan practices transform and extend fan object by using it as inspiration for a fan’s own creative work—this is stuff like writing fan fiction, making vids, remixes, etc.

**Henry Jenkins**
>“Fandom took shape as cultural studies was starting to blur the distinction between consumption and production, with fans valued precisely because they used the contents of mass media as raw materials for their own forms of cultural production.”

### What can media historians learn from fans?

- By looking at those historical instances, we can begin to understand how media worked in everyday life, in different eras.

- Fans are particularly important to media historians because they are often historians themselves!

Hills says that cult fandom:

> “relates not to the intensity, social organization or semiotic/material productivity of the fandom concerned, but to its duration, especially in the absence of ‘new’ or official material in the originating medium. Thus, Star Trek fans did not become ‘cult fans’ historically until the program’s intense popularity persisted after its cancellation…”

- In other words, Hills is saying here that cult fans are fans who continue to love something full-time when there’s no new material to love.

- So, overlooked old movies and canceled television shows often become “cult” media because there’s nothing new except for a group of active fans to continue the discussion.

  - Both *The Rocky Horror Picture Show* and *The Room* become so-called “cult” films when an enduring fan community attends live screenings and builds intricate social practices over a span of years after the film was released.

**Television shows can also be cult media, but it fandom tends not to revolve around screenings with elaborate rituals, since television isn’t usually consumed publicly.**

  - tends to be shows that offer deep dives, rich mythology, or mysteries that can be decoded as a group

### parting thoughts:
As tech has evolved over time a bigger audience exists for cult media; is it still cult media?

### the New Hollywood
- can be used to describe a new set of filmmakers from 60s through the 70s; that's what will be talking about today

//~~**side note; she's also asked us to watch a lot of trailers along with this lecture**~~

//first will go thru general historical stuff about it; then a grab bag of the films


### film changes thru 60s and 70s

1. any remnants of the old studio system fell apart post-1948, when the Paramount decree happened
  - the studios as businesses have staying power, but they must change the way they operate
  - cant release films the same way
2. poor performance after *The Sound of Music* (1965)
3. inc reliance on "calculated blockbuster" (T. Schatz)
  - (will go into more next lecture)
4. loosening of Production Code


#### Jack Valenti
- leader of MPAA from 1966-2004
- officially ended production code (68)
  - replaces w/ age based ratings (68)
- He's a Texan


- the rating system is like the Legion of Decency’s old rating system
  - G rating for general audiences
  - M rating renamed a PG rating; parental guidance suggested
  - PG-13 rating; 1984 based on heart ripping scene *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* MPAA adds PG-13 rating
  - R rating; film restricted to adults unless w/ parent/guardian
  - X rating; restricted to only adults
  - NC-17; 1990 they retired x rating; replaced with NC-17; trademarked it

- they trademarked all of these except X rating; X rating becomes synonymous with porn
  - most newspapers wont advertise x rated movies



### back to timeline; New Hollywood

- most films were on a line graph from taboo-breaking auteurs and profitable
  - a lot of filmmakers used the new freedom from the removal of the production code to bring their new films to light and tell better stories
  - often independent were the auteur films
  - for the 70s; auteur films were profitable; found a place in hollywood; not in 1980s





### art and artistry 0of New Hollywood era



#### *Bonnie and Clyde*
- 1967
- directed by Arthur Penn
- anticipated trends of New Hollywood
- It tells the story of real-life Dust Bowl-era bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.
- felt connected to the anti-establishment values of the 1960s
- polarizing film that pushed the envelope by placing almost slapstick-style comedy scenes next to very grisly scenes of intense, unflinching violence

#### *Night of the Living Dead*

- George Romero
- 1968
- not a Hollywood film
- shoestring budget of just $114,000 and shot it outside Pittsburgh
- blends campy and jokey scenes with boundary-pushing horror




### Making Profits during the New Hollywood era

- New Hollywood era is a bunch of filmmakers combining the politics of the era with relaxed restrictions around what films can show on screen, in order to tell boundary-pushing stories that feel young, vibrant, and even a little bit dangerous

- this is kind of the start of selling directors as superstars in their own right

  - both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas make their debut in the New Hollywood era

### Difficulty of balance of art and profit

- art vs. profit aren’t really opposition to each other in the New Hollywood
  - you get some directors whose films remain much more on the art side of things, like Terrence Malick
  - you get some directors whose films are able to contain that newness in a way that makes it appealing beyond the youth market, like Stephen Spielberg.
  - in the middle, there’s a host of experiments in trying to find the right balance of newness and marketability.


-**the lesson from *Popeye***
  - Building a blockbuster—even with an A-list New Hollywood director and stars and studio money behind you—is far from guaranteed.  
  - Marrying New Hollywood with old Hollywood isn’t exactly like snapping puzzle pieces together.

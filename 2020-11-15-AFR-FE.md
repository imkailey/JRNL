<!-- What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"? -->
"The Colored Museum" was mostly about the historical and current experience of Black people in the Unites States, with a focus on

<!-- 1 --> how slavery and Jim Crow laws affected Black people in the past,

<!-- 2 --> how Black people are currently treated and act in the Unites States today,

<!-- 3 --> and how the past treatment of Black people affects the lives of Black people today.

<!-- think of use of word People of Color as opposed to Black and African American -->
<!-- this play focuses on African Americans more than just People of Color -->

<!-- What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any? -->
<!-- these are the feminist strategies -->
<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
<!--  -->
"The Colored Museum" presented Black women as people, without necessarily playing into stereotypes, especially for that time in media history.
<!-- they definitely use stereotypes -->

While stereotypes are clearly presented throughout the entirety of the performance, they aren't necessarily done in a degrading way to the characters themselves. Instead, it feels as though stereotypes are used to make commentary about how Black people are looked at and treated by our society.

<!-- How does it illuminate the lives of Black women? -->
<!-- these are the feminist strategies -->
<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
"The Colored Museum" tries to present the day to day lives of Black people, including women, in a light that I haven't really seen portrayed before.
<!--  -->
There are a lot of stereotypes presented throughout this work in an illustrative fashion to show how they're seen and treated in society.

<!-- the wig exhibit -->
One of the first examples that comes to mind when talking about how Black women are presented in tcm is the wig exhibit.  <!--(the wig one go find the name)-->
<!--  -->
This exhibit shows an interesting problem that most other groups of people don't even have to think about.
<!--  -->
<br><br>
<!-- the egg exhibit -->
One of the next examples that comes to mind is the egg exhibit. <!-- go find the name -->
<!--  -->
This exhibit is extremely confusing at first blush, and shows off a lot of the different issues that young blk women have to deal with more often than other groups.

The image at the end of her being elated at how she and her children are special, proving her mom wrong, is extremely powerful. The drums from before come back in as...

to begin with the aesthetic differences between this performance and the other works we have read, this performance of "The Colored Museum" was a televised one, whereas most of the other media we've consumed for this class have been readings. however, the more substantial differences start to appear when you look a bit deeper at the material of the media.
<!--  -->
one of the bigger differences is the intended audience of the works. most of the media we've consumed for this class has been for a more academic audience, without that much of an intention to entertain. this work, however, has entertainment at the front of its list of things to do.
<!--  -->
I also love the performances throughout this work. from comedic to serious to everything in between, all of the actors nailed their roles I feel. I really felt the emotion from each actor, and I didn't have a moment where a performance fell flat. considering how emotionally intense some of the scenes are, I would expect someone would give a performance that wasn't the best, however I couldn't find a time where I laughed at an actor for not pulling off a performance.
<!--  -->
<br><br>
getting to the aesthetics and dramatic form,
<!--  -->
throughout the performance, there's the symbol of the drums an how they were taken away when Black people were enslaved. they don't just appear when brought attention to, they appear throughout whole performance.

<!-- think about what I've made in the past and how relates to this work -->

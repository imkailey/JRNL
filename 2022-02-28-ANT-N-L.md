## primate ecology
<!-- maybe talk with professor about my weird sex stuff going on-->


### remember Lamarck y Malthus
- what were their contributions to evolutionary thought
- Lamarckian evolution is in individual evolution
- Malthus said disease and resources keep a population in check

### primate ecology
- study of how primates interact with their environment [inc other organisms]

---

- primates live mostly in tropical habitats
- diverse range of habitats within the tropics
- gallery forest is a forest along a river

---


### niche
- niche = ecological role of an organism in its environment
- a fundamentally concept in ecology
- describes how a species lives in an ecosystem
  - range of conditions necessary for the species to exist
  - impact of species on environment
- descriptions are multidimensional
- description includes:
  - diet
  - locomotion
  - activity pattern
  - ranging pattern
  - predators
  - etc
- variables called ‘niche axes’

### diet
  - all primates need protein carbs fat vitamins, water
- diet: the combination of foods used to satisfy nutritional needs
- main categories
  - animals
  - gums and saps
  - fruit
  - leaves
  - faunivore [insectivore]
  - gummivore
  - frugivore
  - folivore
- omnivore isn’t super meaningful
- all primates eat fruit except
  - tarsiers eat 100% animals

### finding the food
- if sessile, quickly exhaust all the food in the area
- if nomadic, may not know where food is
- solution: home range
  - using same area allows animals to be familiar with distribution of resources, safe refuges,,,

### niche axis: ranging pattern
- home range: area where a primate or group of primates lives
- consistent over time
- animals return to the same resources during the year
- may overlap
- no nomadic primates except humans
- territory: actively defended boundary of all or part of hone Renate
  - conspecifics kept out
  - exclusive access
  - only some primates
- maintaining territory is costly
  - scent marking expensive, calling expensive
  - aggression expensive

### niche axis: ranging pattern

### niche axis: locomotion
- ranging -> selection for efficient locomotion
- substrate use influences type of locomotion
- by minimizing time taken to locate key resources
  - minimize time exposed to risk of predation
  - waste less time and energy in travel

### niche axis: activity pattern
- time is limited
- 3 ways divide 24 hours
  - diurnal
  - nocturnal
  - cathedral
  -  Active day and night

### nice axis: predators
- there are others out there
- most primates share habitats with other primates
- space and resources must be divided

### competitive exclusion principle
- no two organisms have identical ecological niches
- requirements may overlap a lot with one another
- one species will eventually out-compete the other
- ON EXAM

### major implication: if species are to coexist in the same habitat they must differ in their niche in some way to avoid competition
  - ON EXAM?

### competitive exclusion and character displacement
- if niche overlaps and 2 species compete
  - area of overlap incorporated into niche of 1 and other locally extinct
  - area divided between the 2
- realized niche results as 1 or both undergo ecological shift
- shift may involve **character disablement** -> a morphological change that enables 2 species to coexist sympatrically [same habitat]

<!--had issues with keep note crashing and maybe lost all of my notes-->

### slavery
- mexico was one of the first places to abolish lavery in hispanic world
- cuba and brazil were the last in hispanic world

--- before keep crashed ---

### maquiladoras
- assembly plants along us mexico border
- implemented after bracero program ended to make up for lost jobs
- unfinished components shipped into mexico and shipped back to us
- conditions
  - lower wages
  - braceros were not hired: women instead less likely to form unions
  - did not help mexican economy
  - lack of industrialization/ countinued reliance on remittances

### mexicans and racism
- former mexican states enforced jim crow laws
- school segregation and public facilities
- texas - poll tax and literacy tests, lynching
- la - zoot suit riots - police ignored brutality against mexicans
- codes added to home deeds to keep out black people
  - upheld by law
- similar to redlining 

### school segregation
- court cases in 1940s and 50s often declared segregation unconstitutional in the southwest
- desegregation efforts only in the south
- result: de facto segregation thruout the southwest
- by 1973 more mexican american children went to segregated schools than in 1947

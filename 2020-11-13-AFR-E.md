Your paper should connect "The Colored Museum" to one feminist and one performance concept covered in class. It should respond to the questions:
<!--  -->
- What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"?
<!--  -->
- What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any?

- How does it illuminate the lives of Black women?

- How does its aesthetics and use of dramatic form relate with (or depart from) those covered in class?

Your paper should be proofread and well-argued. Draw on specific moments or elements from the performance to corroborate your claims and connect these to specific quotes from the readings.

### Notes

 ---

#### Misc.
- throughout the performance, there's the symbol of the drums an how they were taken away when Black people were enslaved. they don't just appear when brought attention to; throughout whole performance. (go thru and look for when they appear maybe)
   - **look in the script to see if the cues are in there**
   - look in script for changes
   - **are they a motif?**

 ---

#### Portrayals
- think about the different portrayals of Black women throughout the performance
  - during the wig one

    - the mom just wants the house clean
    - reminds kind of like boy scout skit
      - different roles or like archetypes
    - there's a chapter of *Black Feminist Thought* which is about this

#### *Con Flama* Similarities
- demanding for performers and audience
  - for different reasons
  - active readings
  - audience response can change it
- people worked so hard to bring the stuff together;
  - kind of like the colored museum?
>  It illuminates one girl's experience, discovering her own heritage and self, but in the process it also illuminates the selves of many others, their cultures and their lineages and their struggles, in ways that often mirror the girl's.
- Robert Faires "Review: *Con Flama*"

 - when we were reading articles about Sharon Bridgforth's *Con Flama*, there was a description of the performance using all of an actors body and using music and something else like color or something to tell as story; I feel this performance uses that a lot too.

 ---

#### Performativity
- os ns thing; what is it like to be a black man and try to perform Whiteness
- performativity ties in with the Miss Roj exhibit
- trans people and stuff too
- sometimes don't have choice in how we perform ourselves

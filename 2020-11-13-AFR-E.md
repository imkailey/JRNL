Your paper should connect "The Colored Museum" to one feminist and one performance concept covered in class. It should respond to the questions:
<!--  -->
- What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"?
<!--  -->
- What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any?

- How does it illuminate the lives of Black women?

- How does its aesthetics and use of dramatic form relate with (or depart from) those covered in class?

Your paper should be proofread and well-argued. Draw on specific moments or elements from the performance to corroborate your claims and connect these to specific quotes from the readings.

<!-- What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"? -->
"The Colored Museum" was mostly about the historical and current experience of Black people in the Unites States, with a focus on

<!-- 1 --> how slavery and Jim Crow laws affected Black people in the past,

<!-- 2 --> how Black people are currently treated and act in the Unites States today,

<!-- 3 --> and how the past treatment of Black people affects the lives of Black people today.

"The Colored Museum" presented Black women as people, without necessarily playing into stereotypes, especially for that time in media history.
<!-- they definitely use stereotypes -->

While stereotypes are clearly presentes throughout the entirety of the performance, they aren't necessarily done in a degrading way to the characters themselves. Instead, it feels as though stereotypes are used to make commentary about how Black people are looked at and treated by our society.

<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
"The Colored Museum" tries to present the day to day lives of Black people, including women, in a light that I haven't really seen portrayed before.
<!--  -->
There are a lot of stereotypes presented throughout this work in an illustrative fashion to show how they're seen and treated in society.

<!--  -->
<!-- the wig exhibit -->
One of the first examples that comes to mind when talking about how Black women are presented in tcm is the wig exhibit.  <!--(the wig one go find the name)-->
<!--  -->
This exhibit shows an interesting problem that most other groups of people don't even have to think about. 
<!--  -->
<br><br>
<!-- the egg exhibit -->
One of the next examples that comes to mind is the egg exhibit. <!-- go find the name -->
<!--  -->
This exhibit is extremely confusing at first blush, and shows off a lot of the different issues that young blk women have to deal with more often than other groups. 
<!--  -->
The image at the end of her being elated at how she and her children are special, proving her mom wrong, is extremely powerful. The drums from before come back in as...

<!-- this part is supposed to be about stuff like the jazz aesthetic, movement, color, etc. -->

to begin with the aesthetic differences between this performance and the other works we have read, this performance of "The Colored Museum" was a televised one, whereas most of the other media we've consumed for this class have been readings. however, the more substantial differences start to appear when you look a bit deeper at the material of the media.
<!--  -->
one of the bigger differences is the intended audience of the works. most of the media we've consumed for this class has been for a more academic audience, without that much of an intention to entertain. this work, however, has entertainment at the front of its list of things to do.
<!--  -->
I also love the performances throughout this work. from comedic to serious to everything in between, all of the actors nailed their roles I feel. I really felt the emotion from each actor, and I didn't have a moment where a performance fell flat. considering how emotionally intense some of the scenes are, I would expect someone would give a performance that wasn't the best, however I couldn't find a time where I laughed at an actor for not pulling off a performance.
<!--  -->
<br><br>
getting to the aesthetics and dramatic form,
<!--  -->
throughout the performance, there's the symbol of the drums an how they were taken away when Black people were enslaved. they don't just appear when brought attention to, they appear throughout whole performance.

<!-- think about what I've made in the past and how relates to this work -->

 ### Notes

 ---

 #### Misc.
- throughout the performance, there's the symbol of the drums an how they were taken away when Black people were enslaved. they don't just appear when brought attention to; throughout whole performance. (go thru and look for when they appear maybe)
   - **look in the script to see if the cues are in there**
   - look in script for changes
   - **are they a motif?**

 ---

#### Portrayals
- think about the different portrayals of Black women throughout the performance
  - during the wig one
    - talk about the hair stuff
    - how can relate to different groups like trans people
    - this ties into the feminism/Black feminism question
  - the different members of the family in the all Black musical
    - gone with the wind
      - first black woman to get an Oscar couldn't go to the screening
      - Hatty Mcdaniel
      - got heat for being stereotype
    - each person has like horse blinders on
    - the mom just wants the house clean
    - reminds kind of like boy scout skit
      - different roles or like archetypes
    - there's a chapter of *Black Feminist Thought* which is about this
    - its literally a show
    - the guys in Blackface in the background
    - time period
  - Miss Roj
    - performative femininity
    - violence against LGBT people
    - femininity
    - how does feminism play into this
    - how marginalization plays into the aggressive character
      - look into aggressive as word used
      - cathartic
    - being that sure of yourself and confident in who you are and the space to be safe in who you are
    - alcoholism
  - the egg one
    - teen pregnancy
    - mom is just awful
    - she's told she isn't special; hammered in
    - but then she is and her kids are
    - the drums
- think about how other races are portrayed; specifically relation to White people
  - all Black musical three guys in Blackface in the background of the tv stuff

 ---

 #### *Con Flama* Similarities
- demanding for performers and audience
  - for different reasons
  - active readings
  - audience response can change it
- people worked so hard to bring the stuff together;
  - kind of like the colored museum?
>  It illuminates one girl's experience, discovering her own heritage and self, but in the process it also illuminates the selves of many others, their cultures and their lineages and their struggles, in ways that often mirror the girl's.
- Robert Faires "Review: *Con Flama*"

 - when we were reading articles about Sharon Bridgforth's *Con Flama*, there was a description of the performance using all of an actors body and using music and something else like color or something to tell as story; I feel this performance uses that a lot too.

 ---

 #### Performativity
- os ns thing; what is it like to be a black man and try to perform Whiteness
- performativity ties in with the Miss Roj exhibit
- trans people and stuff too
- sometimes don't have choice in how we perform ourselves

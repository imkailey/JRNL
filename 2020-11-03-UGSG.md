<!--what you are going to change for your full study?-->
<!---->
<p>
We are going to focus our data collection mostly on
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
Beats Per Minute, 
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
Socio-economic factors, 
<!---->
instruments used,
<!---->
<!---->
and key. 
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
This will allow us to take the less important data and focus on getting more data points for our study. 
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
we will also be re-evaluating what curriculum we actually measure and evaluate by. 
<!---->
<!---->

For example, more recently we realised we overlooked woodwinds like saxophones in our instrument categories. As you may know, saxophones were kinda important in the development of jazz and other popular music in the 1920s and 1930s. However, luckily we caught this and have accounted for it in our data.

we're also going to be gathering more data over time. when looking at the data we have it right now, trends become pretty obvious the more data you throw in. sadly, im not sure we can gather data for a wider selection of music, but we are going to be tryinf to simplify as much of the process as possible so we can collect more samples.

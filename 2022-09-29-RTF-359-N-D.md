<!--3, back by 10 til 3-->
### misgivings around trans people 
- going on hormones for trans women greatly affects their performance
- testosterone works in tandem with other hormones to give you your performance 
- trans women still struggle when it comes to sports around a similar level as cis female athletes 
- focusing on elementary school level sports for trans children isnt really borne out in the research
- often misgendered and have their gender identity questioned
- often the standards that are applied to professional athletes are applied to children and its seen as one issue 
- often have a hard time agreeing on facts when it comes to trans athletes 
- often older ideas of gender and sex affect things today
- cultural differences in how we raise boys versus girls causes a bigger gap in performance than there should be naturally

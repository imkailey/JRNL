### exam 2
- mostly lectures
- content is everything
- be ready for list questions
- be ready for definitions
- language right off her slide
  - can be not exact wording
  - try to get it right tho
- fossil species on Wednesday
  - very important
- write stuff out
- geological timescale
- make sure review everything
- from Feb 28 - Mar30
- not really math
- Hamilton's rule is a small part

## functional morphology
- relationship between form and function

### positional behaviors
- posture and locomotion
- posture
  - sitting
  - hanging
  - squatting
  - etc
- locomotion = movement
- pronograde = prone
  - horizontal during locomotion
- orthograde
  - vertical during locomotion

### arboreal quadrupedalism
- move on trees on four legs
- adaptations for moving in this environment

### terrestrial quadrupedalisam
- on four legs on ground

### pronograde: quadrupedalism
- arboreal
  - hindlimbs slightly longer than forelimbs
  - limbs short relative to the body
  - relatively long digits
  - relatively long tails
- terrestrial
  - legs all same length
  - limbs long compared to body
  - short digits
  - short tails

### knuckle walking
- special case of terrestrial quadrupedalism
- adaptations for both suspension and terrestrial movement
- long digits
- long forelimbs

### orthograde: vertical climbing and leaping
- limb propulsion and grasping
- hind limb length > forelimb length
- long hands and feet

### orthograde: suspension
- adaptations for forelimb propulsion
- forelimb length> hindlimb length
- flexible joints
- short trunk

### orthograde : bipedalism
- adaptations for hindlimb propulsion and balance over a single supporting limb
- hind limb length > forelimb
- many more adaptations

### limb proportions
- intermembral index way qualify limb proportions
- limb proportions are related to positional behaviors

forelimb length x 100 = imi
- - - - - - -
hindlimb length

humerus + radius x 100
- - - - - - -
femur + tibia

- pg3 reading chart for IMI
- quadupedal: 80-100
- suspensory > 100
- leaping / bipedalism 70 or lower

### understanding movement
- lever systems
  - how muscles act on bone to enact movement
- muscle function
  - muscle insertion site morphology
- range of motion
  - joint surface morphology

### lever systems and motion
- axis of rotation = joint
- force = muscle
  - force arm = perpendicular distance between line of action of the muscle and joint center
- resistance = object being moved
  - find in lecture slides
- resistance = load
- all lever systems need have these components
- can be moved into different configurations
- focus on what's in the middle (ARF)
  - 1st: axis
  - 2nd: resistance
  - 3rd: force

### lever system: power and speed
- power: how large load can move given the force
- speed: how far load can be moved in a given time
- when comparing two lever systems
  - relatively long force arm: more power
- relatively long resistance arm: more speed

### muscle insertion morphology
- indicative of muscle

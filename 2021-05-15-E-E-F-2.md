### question 1
- From its inception, the United States has been characterized as an unmatched “city upon a hill.” 
- Such a promise-filled characterization<!--, manifest in claims of U.S. exceptionalism,--> pivots on a reading of the country as a utopic place 
  - of possibility, 
  - a space of equality 
  - a site of unparalleled liberty. 
- However, over the course of the semester, we have considered works by U.S. writers that destabilize such optimistic representations. 
  - How have these authors challenged the notion of U.S. exceptionalism? 
  - How does their work highlight the disconnect between what the United States of America “should be” and what the United States “is”?

the course of this short story, the wallpaper is really a direct
analogy to her relation to the abuse of her husband, along with
society as large. There's about five stages that the narrator goes
through during this, with the fourth being the longest and most
complex. </font></font>

going to put both of the first two stages together, as they're both
pretty short. at the beginning, she just believes that the wallpaper
is "almost revolting,"[page 5] without having had much time to examine it. this can be seen
through the lens of her perception of her abuse at this point. she
sees it as just an ugly and bad thing, without having examined the
nuances yet<!--  --> she eventually starts to see the wallpaper as
menacing. Through the lens of her perception of her abuse, this can
be seen as her realizing that her husband constantly surveilling her,
her husband constantly managing who she gets to meet with, where she
can go, and when, is a very menacing state of affairs. She has to
creep around the house she lives in, and not feeling safe in your own
house is one of the worst things that you can ever feel. </font></font>

starts to see the holes at the edge of the wallpaper, showing the
holes of her abuse. she starts to see that her husband can't see
everything she does, and that he doesn't have complete control over
her. she hides her journal, she can sneak around, she has a little
bit of control over her situation. She also realizes that she is
likely in what previously was a nursery for a young child, due to the
heavy furniture and smudges in the wallpaper. She realizes she's
literally being treated like a sick child, being told she needs bed
rest until she gets better, even when she complains that it isn't
helping. The narrator starts to notice a pattern behind the main
pattern of the wallpaper. this gets cut off due to Jennie, the
narrators husbands sister, who will be the narrators new caretaker.
after this incident, however, the narrators disgusted fascination
with the wallpaper continues to get worse and worse. </font></font>

a certain point, the narrator becomes even more fascinated with the
wallpaper, but she starts to hide her realizations and interest in
the design. She appears to be tranquil to her husband, but the
wallpaper haunts her everywhere. she can always smell the stench of
the wallpaper, even when she's outside. She can't sleep well anymore,
as she falls more and more into the pattern. she finally realizes what firgue she saw behind the design and is "quite sure it is a woman," [Page 17] and identifies with this woman strongly.<!--  -->
When someone finally fully realizes the extent to which they are
being abused, they can often fall down a rabbit hole of finding how
bad it really is. They pay attention to every detail of it, and it
can really consume their consciousness. This is what i believe to be
happening to the narrator.<!--  --> Jennie, while talking to the
narrator and touching the wallpaper, recounts how she found yellow
stains on both of their clothes when she did the laundry. This is the
effects of similar trauma being seen in the both of them. Both of
them have been affected in similar ways, even if Jennie is helping
John keep the narrator in the room. </font></font>

is the final stage, where the narrator sees the girl trapped in the
paper clearly, and decides she needs to free her. she starts peeling
the paper in the middle of the night, "before morning [she] had peeled off yards of that paper."[page 23] Finding herself alone the next day, she goes into a frenzy of
biting and clawing the paper off, trying to free the woman behind the
paper. This is essentially her trying to deconstruct the system of
abuse she's in by leaving, or by getting her husband out. upon seeing
this, her husband passes out, and she's free to do what she wants.
However, she still isn't free of the trauma she had inflicted on her

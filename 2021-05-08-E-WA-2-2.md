over the course of this short story, the wallpaper is really a direct analogy to her relation to the abuse of her husband, along with society as large. There's about five stages that the narrator goes through during this, with the fourth being the longest and most complex.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm going to put both of the first two stages together, as they're both pretty short. at the beginning, she just believes that the wallpaper is ugly, without having had much time to examine it. this can be seen through the lens of her perception of her abuse at this point. she sees it as just an ugly and bad thing, without having examined the nuances yet
<!--  -->
 she eventually starts to see the wallpaper as menacing. Through the lens of her perception of her abuse, this can be seen as her realizing that her husband constantly surveilling her, her husband constantly managing who she gets to meet with, where she can go, and when, is a very menacing state of affairs. She has to creep around the house she lives in, and not feeling safe in your own house is one of the worst things that you can ever feel.

 she starts to see the holes at the edge of the wallpaper, showing the holes of her abuse. she starts to see that her husband cant see everything she does, and that he doesn't have complete control over her. she hides her journal, she can sneak around, she has a little bit of control over her situation. she also realizes that she is likely in what previously was a nursery for a young child, due to the heavy furniture and smudges in the wallpaper. She realizes she's literally being treated like a sick child, being told she needs bed rest until she gets better, even when she complains that it isnt helping.

 the narrator starts to notice a patern behind the main pattern of the wallpaper. this gets cut off due to Jennie, the narrators husbands sister, who will be the narrators new caretaker. after this incident, however, the narrators disgusted fascination with the wallpaper continues to get worse and worse.

 After a certain point, the narrator becomes even more fascinated with the wallpaper, but she starts to hide her realizations and interest in the design. She appears to be tranquil to her husband, but the wallpaper haunts her everywhere. she can always smell the stench of the wallpaper, even when she's outside. She can't sleep well anymore, as she falls more and more into the pattern.

 When someone finally fully realizes the extent to which they are being abused, they can often fall down a rabbit hole of finding how bad it really is. They pay attention to every detail of it, and it can really consume their consciousness. This is what I believe to be happening to the narrator.
 <!--  -->
 Jennie, while talking to the narrator and touching the wallpaper, recounts how she found yellow stains on both of their clothes when she did the laundry. This is the effects of similar trauma being seen in the both of them. Both of them have been affected in similar ways, even if Jennie is helping John keep the narrator in the room.

## Color blind racism 
- racism still exists today even though we don't see it all the time
- the idea of color blind racism is often used to excuse racism from white people without them knowing
- find out when released
- misgendered a trans person possibly, only said transsexual
- "if racism is over why are there still racial disparities"
  - in the past was thought bc genetic differences
  - also thinking ppl like they own race

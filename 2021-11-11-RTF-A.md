### thesis

#### broken down
- characters
  - For the most part, the gangster genre focuses on the criminals making or selling the drugs. However, in the tv show Narcos this is filtered through the narcotics officer hunting down Pablo Escobar, and in the film The Untouchables they put this completely on its head, focusing on the cops tracking down on Al Capone and barely covering Al Capone's escapades.

- Iconography
  - The gangster genre generally focuses on the distribution of the drugs, with large urban sprawls and drug dealers. The Untouchables does follow this for the most part, with a lot of scenes taking place in the city. In contrast, Narcos for the most part focuses on the production of cocaine, and how Pablo Escobar got into that.

- What going to do 
  - In this paper, I'm going to be going over how the TV show Narcos and the film The Untouchables compare to gangster genre more broadly when it comes to their character and iconography.

#### TA Note
I suggest creating a sentence that succinctly identifies what you want to
do in the paper. In that sentence, I suggest identifying the two generic
elements you will be comparing or contrasting (or doing both) across the
media forms and arguing both what is happening and why it is important.
This sentence might serve to clarify what you are saying in the sentences
you sent me. 

### body 1
The characters of The Untouchables aren't the normal bunch for a gangster film. For the most part gangster films focus on the criminals that are creating and selling the drugs. However, The Untouchables focuses on the people actually trying to put away Al Capone, and all the things they go through. 









## Thomas Schatz "The Gangster Film"
- the classical hollywood gangster film was the shortest lived of the classical genres

### The gangster-hero and the urban milieu
- Unlike the Westerner and the hardboiled detective, who were adapted to thescreen from popular literary genres, 
- the screen gangster was lifted directly fromthe current newspaper headlines.
- weren't the most realistic
- As Hollywood's characterization of the criminal was taken out of the controlled studio environment and away from performers like Cagney, Robinson, and Bogart, the genre underwent a radical revision of its own mythology
- the mythology of the classical gangster film is like in western, in that it takes place on the cusp of the transition to modern society

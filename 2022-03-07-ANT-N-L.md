## sex,gender, sexuality - what is the biology
### sex determination
- vertebrates: sex is determined by many strategies implying genetic, environmental influences, or both
- Often varies among closely related species

### how biologists define sex
- chromosomes?
  - most xy and xx
  - However thereâ€™s still a lot of variation 
- anatomy?
  - a lot of variation 
- pregnancy?
- Parental care?
- behavior?
- Dominance?
- Competitiveness?
- Gamete size
  - some precise change sex during their lifetime
  - Human gametes

### 3 reasons group living reduces predation risk 
1. Detection 
2. Deterrence
3. Dilution 
- IMPORTANT

### 2 types competition 
1. Scramble
  - 
2. Contest
  - group living 

### costs group GO FIND

### gregarious animals have volved ways to deal with living in close proximity 
- elevator effect

### another benefit group
- defense of resources
- larger groups help

### key concept
- distribution of resources and risks has strong influences on social relationships
- reproduction is limited by resources
- Female rs most limited by food
- Male rs most limited by females 
- Not just any females, estrous famales
  - estrus: heat, a period of heightened sexual activity and receptivity exhibited by female mammals, usually around ovulation
- distribution of resources > distribution of females > distribution of males > social system

### ecology influences social system by affecting group size 
- social system: composition of the group
- Mating system: number of sexual partners that individuals have

### social system
1. Solitary
2. Pair [family]
3. Single-male [bachelor groups]
4. Multi-male single-female
5. Multi-male multi-female
- IMPORTANT 

### mating system 
- monogamy: pair
- Polygyny: many females one male
- Polyandry: many males one female
- Polygynandry: many males many females
- IMPORTANT

## sexual selection 
<!--not writing rn-->
- sexual selection: form of natural selection when individuals differ in their ability to compete with others for mates or to attract members of the opposite sex


- female primates cannot increase res much by number of mates but can up it a lot by upping offspring survival 

### 3 types sexual selection
1. Int**ra**sexual selection: competition for mates within a sex
  - traits to improve fighting ability, endurance, sperm
  - Often leads to sexual dimorphism
- Distribution of mates is also determined by the type of competition: contest or scramble
  - contest
    - hierarchies, weapons, mate guarding 
  - no hierarchies: scramble and sperm competition

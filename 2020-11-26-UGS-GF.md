A requirement of all signature courses is to visit one of the amazing institutions or campus spaces that make UT Austin special.

Write a reflection essay about your experience at one of the GEMS of UT. A GEM is a unique resource at the University of Texas at Austin. Think the Harry Ransom Center, BFL, The Blanton. I can no longer find the complete list of GEMS on the Signature Course Website, so if you aren't sure if something is a GEM, please get in touch with me. The Signature Course Folks are highlighting a few of these and you can find links at the bottom.

You may attend a GEM virtually.

The paper should be 1 page single spaced or two double space. Unless it is a poem, which is totally fine too and can be shorter. Do not do the Blanton. We will do this as a group.

While the due date is rolling, you must submit it within one week of visiting. You have until the last class day (December 7th) to submit this GEM. Have fun with it!

Contact: Amanda Melancon, Assistant Education Specialist

    Nearly five months have passed since the COVID-19 pandemic forced closure of the LBJ Library’s doors, and the ongoing health crisis makes it impossible to know when we might reopen. The library’s staff has been hard at work on a number of initiatives to assure the institution continues to flourish despite unprecedented challenges. Their education specialists recently completed a series of online webinars led by top scholars on the history of the LBJ era, and more sessions are planned for the fall. The museum team, meanwhile, has created a number of virtual exhibits (Links to an external site.)== highlighting the library’s permanent exhibit. And, in partnership with the LBJ Foundation, the library has planned a number of high-profile public programs, including a virtual event to mark the hundredth anniversary of the constitutional amendment giving American women the right to vote.

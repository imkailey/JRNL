### afro latinos
- who is afro latino
  - latinos in the us who are of african ancestry and choose blackness as a racial identity
  - choosing race and ethnicity - what are the differences
- why is blackness among latinos denied or invisible
- when we use latino as a race we lose a lot of the diversity among latino ppl
- in mexico they have avoided talking about black people that are there bc they got rid of slavery fast, but there's still a lot of Black people there

### afro latinos on the US census
- 50% latinos identify as white in 2010
  - 20% in 2020

### mestizaje
- mestizaje
  - latin american population is racially mixed [indigenous, african, european]
  - creates racial harmony
  - suggests racism and racial inequality are not issues in latin america
  - US as te antithesis of mestizaje - is this accurate?
- in l.a there wasnt as bad as racial segregation in the past, but weren't as explicit
  - used language of racial harmony to stop conversations about racial injustice
  - *was* better than the worst places, but still covered up bad stuff
  - racial harmony language was to make l.a look better than the u.s
  - the phrenology of the u.s wouldve hurt everyone in l.a
  - racial mixing best for the society l.a view

- whitening in latin marica
  - government programs to whiten thte countries - argentina cuba brazil etc
  - resources given to european immigrants to work and live in l.a
  - based on racial hierarcy and competing in the global economy
- "mejorar la raza"
  - mestizaje as a means to dilute blackness
  - try to marry lighter

  - created racial hierarchy and middle categories - mestizos, mulatos
- anzaldua as transcending vasconcelos 

### race

- whitening as a legacy of trauma fear and alienation
  - often promoted by mestizos

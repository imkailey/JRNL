## preface fred doug
- this white guy speaks weird; old 
- gives high praise to fred doug; this to speak higly so wht ppl listen
- preface author had to convince FD to start to speak out more broadly; kinda didn't want to; uncharted waters
- prefacer goes: holy shit how arent these ppl more fucked; slavery is so bad holy shit
- Ex of White slave going in caseafter a few years
- sits around work that FD was actually treated well as a slave in comparison; still horrific
- a lot of christian imagery employed here
- almost anarchist take against slavery
  - institutions necessary to hold eslv mean they cant be treated well 
- preface May 1 1845

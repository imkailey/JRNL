## English Final Questions


### question 1
- From its inception, the United States has been characterized as an unmatched “city upon a hill.” 
- Such a promise-filled characterization<!--, manifest in claims of U.S. exceptionalism,--> pivots on a reading of the country as a utopic place 
  - of possibility, 
  - a space of equality 
  - a site of unparalleled liberty. 
- However, over the course of the semester, we have considered works by U.S. writers that destabilize such optimistic representations. 
  - How have these authors challenged the notion of U.S. exceptionalism? 
  - How does their work highlight the disconnect between what the United States of America “should be” and what the United States “is”?

### question 2
- According to acclaimed U.S. writer, James Baldwin, 
  - “an identity…[is] arrived at by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience.” 
- We have, over the course of the semester, considered a number of works wherein identity plays a central role.

- You can certainly use a text that you may have previously analyzed for one of the assigned response paper prompts. And, you may find that you are accessing the same quotes from that text (which is perfectly fine). 
- HOWEVER, the questions that comprise the final exam will force you to think about that text in a different way
  - the argument will be different though you may be using the same text.

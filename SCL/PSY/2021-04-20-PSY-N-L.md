### intro
- we are going to be talking about abnormal psychology today
<!--we took a survey about normal and abnormal psychological states-->
- they want us to work with what we think is normal and abnormal in a group chat

### the DSM
- a big book with a list of symptoms for disorders
- we can only look at the symptoms of mental disorders
  - we cant look at the underlying causes

### **anxiety**
- we took a quiz on anxiety
  - I tested high obviously lol

#### agoraphobia
- having a specific fear stimuli
- this makes the fear worse over time
- catastrophization

#### PTSD study
- how do people differ when it comes to their anxiety
- one guy freaked out, the other had a lot of fun
- first one is more prone to PTSD
- this isn't an innate thing, if you think about anxiety in the classical conditioning sense
  - a lot of it is behavioral exposing to the fear thing
  - people afraid of their own body are exposed to things in their bod that will not hurt them
  - this is extremely effective in helping out people with anxiety

### comorbidity
<!--whos in experts chair-->
- if someone has one mental disorder, theyre likely to have other ones
- a lot of the research is trying to figure out why its a thing across fields in psychology

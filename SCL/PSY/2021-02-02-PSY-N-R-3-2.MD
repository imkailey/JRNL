## failure is moving science forward

### intro
- power poses were thought to help with confidence and hormonal boosts, but subsequent studies were unable to find or substantiate this

### reproducibility crisis
- we haven't been able to reproduce a bunch of studies bc everyone is trying to find crazy discoveries to make money
  - hasn't been shown to be a huge thing in psych yet?
  - at least is contentious
- seemingly esoteric factors in a study can lead to a difference in results
- there's so many variables that can change the results of a study
  - sample size
  - gender balance
  - demographics
  - etc
  - these things are on a case by case basis
- be humble
- you can be wrong sometimes

## conditioning and learning
- classical ideas of conditioning are based on Pavlov's experiments
  - this may seem reductive, but it's still studied today and is a valid lens to look at things thru
- dog food in Pavlov's experiment is unconditioned stimulus [US]
  - causes unconditioned response [UR]
    - drooling
- conditioned stimulus [CS] is a signal that has nothing to do with unconditioned stimulus
  - in Pavlov's experiment: is the bell
- conditioned stimulus causes conditioned response [CR]
- although classical conditioning is powerful, there's other lenses
  - operant conditioning
    - Skinner
    - mostly focuses on voluntary things, while classical pays attention to involuntary things
- classical conditioning can be overwritten with time
  - if there's enough time without the stimulus, it can cause erasure called extinction
- another type conditioning
  - instrumental conditioning
- these are the main three types of conditioning

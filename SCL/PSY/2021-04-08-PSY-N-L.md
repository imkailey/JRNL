### equality vs inequality
- we really value fairness as people
- many people want a way more equal distribution of wealth
  - not completely equal, however
- inequality makes people less agreeable
  - highly stratifies societies cause less cohesion between people in a society


- people in more equal societies perceive themselves as better well off even if materially the same of someone in a more unequal society
- higher income people have more predictability in their lives
  - poorer people have more unpredictability
  - predictability has huge effects on the psyche as well

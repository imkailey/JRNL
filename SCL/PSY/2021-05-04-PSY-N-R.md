## psychology of groups 
### The Need to Belong
- people often say theyre independent from others, but at the same time try really hard to fit into groups
- people seek inclusion over exclusion
- people have a *need to belong*
  - most of us satisfy this by joining groups 
  - 50-80% ppl surveyed were active in a group 
- 
### Affiliation in Groups
- Leon Festinger’s theory of social comparison (1950, 1954) suggested that in many cases people join with others to evaluate the accuracy of their personal beliefs and attitudes 
- Stanley Schachter (1959) explored this process by putting individuals in ambiguous, stressful situations and asking them if they wished to wait alone or with others He found that people affiliate in such situations—they seek the company of others
- some cases, we also prefer to join with others who are even worse off than we are
### Identity and Membership
- groups are not only founts of information during times of ambiguity, they also help us answer the existentially significant question, “Who am I?”
-  The self is not just a “me,” but also a “we”
## persuasion so easily fooled
- Persuasion theorists distinguish between the central and peripheral routes to persuasion
- The central route employs direct, relevant, logical messages 
  - the central route is intended to produce enduring agreement
- The peripheral route, on the other hand, relies on superficial cues that have little to do with logic
  - the peripheral approach is the salesman’s way of thinking
often exploits rule-of-thumb heuristics that trigger mindless reactions 
  - The peripheral approach is also common in the darkest of persuasion programs, such as those of dictators and cult leaders

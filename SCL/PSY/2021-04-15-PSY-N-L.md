### race and tensions to do with that?
<!--started out by taking a quiz on how much you understand about racial and ethnic issues in the us, ut, and how much you were in the past-->
- people are more likely so see issues at a national level, but less so at a local area
- when you have white and nonwhite people, they have different experiences
- White people might not understand issues they don't have to deal with
  - this goes for everyone
  - people can tend to downplay others' issues
- in psychology, often we use different ideas of race and racism normally talked about
- individuals don't feel things as a class
- you can have a belief about a group independent
  - you may have stereotypes without prejudice

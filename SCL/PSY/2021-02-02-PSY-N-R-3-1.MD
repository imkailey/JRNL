- examining the data
- inferring the data- drawing conclusions

### two fundamental aspects statistical thinking
- data vary
- analyzing pattern of variation
  - distribution
  - often helps with insight

### statistical significance
- even when patterns exist, you need to know that that pattern most likely isn't due to random chance
  - where statistical significance comes in
- correlation doesn't equal causation

### generalizability
- if sample is more like population you're studying, the more you can generalize the data to the population

### conclusion
- researchers use the scientific method
  - hypothesis
  - design study
  - conduct study
  - analyze data
  - report results
- be careful when/how you generalize

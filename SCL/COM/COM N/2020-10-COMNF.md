- choosing your news
  - what are the implications of that

##### how things have changed
- we used to look at the same media as a nation
  - had a unifying effect
- now we have many sources of news to go to because of the internet

#### four questions
1. what influences the public news
2. why public make their choices
3. what is the effect of the publics choices of media
4. what should we do

---

1. what influences the public news
  - selective exposure
    - motivated selection of entertainment based off your beliefs
  - partisanship exposure based off your political beliefs
    - people typically pick places that confirm their beliefs
  - do people prefer likeminded news?
    - may seek out partisan sources bc its what around
    - magazine study tried to find that out
      - table had magazines
      - person in lobby monitoring
      - partisanship influenced what they picked
2. why public make their choices
  - people find things against their view biased; whether or not it's partisan
    - if non partisan; two sides angry at each other
  - hostile media effect
    - seen as biased against us
3. what is the effect of the publics choices of media
  - relative hostile media effect
    - if its slightly leaning one way or other; people see it as heavily leaning one way or another
  - selective exposure = political polarization
    - also inspires political participation
    - leads people to think about different issues
4. what to do
  - diversify media exposure
    - look at things on both sides; talk with others; like going to gym
    - need to be charitable
    - argue with others in good faith

### Keynote: Dr. Strover

#### public communication policy
- tech has a social context
- public framework for public good
- media is private businesses, but regulated for public good
- site of struggle between political, business, and citizen/consumer interests
- influences by view of communications systems as:
  - commodities
  - engines of economic growth
  - basic social infrastructure
    - so we know what's going on separate from government

#### free speech
- intellectual property
  - to encourage people to create
  - to protect artists

#### 1934 communication act
- serve "public interest, convenience, or necessity"
- provide all people in US national radio communication service
- public interest language applies to all regular media
  - radio
  - telephone
  - TV
- adequate facilities; reasonable charges
  - applies to internet now
- **public interest has 100+ yr roots**

#### marketplace of ideas
- has to do with theory that marketplace vibrant and robust
- when lots good ideas will overpower bad ones
- has everything to do with more speech is how to counteract bad speech
  - very pertinent with social media
  - didn't take into account how much bad speech there is
  - currently this is contentious
- how do you cultivate a healthy marketplace

##### marketplace ideas - competition
- part of theory behind looking at media ownership
  - as long as have competing ideas; often will be enough
  - but the marketplace (literal) constantly changing
  - current media companies own everything
  - very little diversity of ownership in these places
    - we should keep an eye on this
    - often times diversity is limited by ownership

#### more having to do with that act above
- equitable access/universal service
  - everyone access at
    - comparable rates
    - comparable quality

##### localism
- local media services
- as opposed to interconnection
  - we want lots of it and fast and everywhere
  - want it to work well

#### national security
- some of our things to do with national security is a communications issue
- what governments can do with our data is a big thing in communications policy

#### takeaways
<p><b>we all want and need better functioning communications systems to work well today; this is important to everyone and we want this to be fixed and stuff</b></p>

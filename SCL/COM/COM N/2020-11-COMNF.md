- has everything to do with more speech is how to counteract bad speech
  - very pertinent with social media
  - didn't take into account how much bad speech there is
  - currently this is contentious
- how do you cultivate a healthy marketplace

- part of theory behind looking at media ownership
  - as long as have competing ideas; often will be enough
  - but the marketplace (literal) constantly changing
  - current media companies own everything

  - everyone access at
    - comparable rates
    - comparable quality

#### takeaways
<p><b>we all want and need better functioning communications systems to work well today; this is important to everyone and we want this to be fixed and stuff</b></p>

### sports, media, and politics

#### are sports/media political

- prevailing thought used to be no
- reality is that it really is and always has been

#### history of sports media
- modern sports developed mid-to-late 19th century
- both sports and media grew up together
- viewing of sports as apolitical appealed to multiple audiences

#### sports/media concepts
- sports/media complex
- mediasport
- mediatization
- all reflect commercial interests
  - reinforce traditional power dynamics and structures

#### sports/media are political
- more recently; liberalization has happened in s/m
- development has changed access and reporting 
- athletes have more control
- much of whats viewed as "liberal" is related to sports directly

#### conservative politics in sports media
- women more than 40% athletes in U.S.; receive 5-8% coverage
- Black athletes receive substancial coverage; only 10% sports reporters Black
- ownership and management; overwhelmingly white men
- nationalism/militarianism in sports

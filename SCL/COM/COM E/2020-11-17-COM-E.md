When it comes to todays' world, the news moves very quickly and it’s difficult to tell what’s true or not. Dr. Woolley’s lecture helped me to know what to look for when looking at the legitimacy of a news source, and a lens with which to look at media in a different light than before.

Today’s news climate is an ever-changing landscape of 24 hour news and blog spam makes it very difficult to figure out where a claim originated from or its validity without a lot of research and time none of us have. Luckily, there are a lot of things you can look at surrounding a claim or an article to try and see if it is true or not. Dr. Woolley went through a lot of ways people can be mislead in our current media climate, from encrypted propaganda to geographic propaganda, and I’d like to talk about a few of them and how being aware of them and how that knowledge can help you to be closer to the truth.
<!--  -->

Starting off, lets start at a pretty obvious starting point, the beginning of the lecture. Woolley began by telling the story of a nano-influencer, a small influencer with under 5,000 followers on a given platform, and how she went from a typical mom blogger to a conspiracy theorist. Woolley then discusses the ways in which people go from pretty normal political stances and beliefs to the far end.
<!--  -->

<!--  -->
One of the first ways he goes on to discuss is computational propaganda, the manipulating of social media algorithms to get to people they know are vulnerable to their types of thought. For example, trying to target Anti-Vaccination social media posts to young mothers who want to do the best to keep their children safe and out of harm. The level of tracking we have on social media and in our technology in general is to the level that advertisers or large creators can pretty easily get to people they can manipulate.
<BR><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another way Woolley says people can be manipulated is through geological propaganda; this is the targeting of people in a certain location with advertisements and propaganda. There are trackers in pretty much everything nowadays, whether or not you have your phone location on. This information can very easily be used to target individuals along with all of the information gathered through social media.
<!--  -->
<BR><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!--  -->
Yet another terrifying way that disinformation and misinformation are spread is through encrypted propaganda. Encrypted propaganda is propaganda that is spread through individual messaging and group chat applications like  GroupMe and WhatsApp. <!-- find out how those are capitalized-->
<!--  -->
The way this happens is that when people go looking for groups of people that think similarly politically nearby them, often it’s people from other places infiltrating these circles. This is a lot of what happened with Russia in 2016. Russians would essentially create groups of people in different areas based on political divides, and continue to pull at the seams until something went wrong. This ended up being extremely effective, with Russians being able to organize both protests and the counter protests to those protests in Texas around that time frame. It’s absolutely insane the lengths people will go to affect political change, and a lot of people underestimate that and how effective these strategies can be.

<!--  -->
These strategies can even be used to mess with traditional news sources. While traditional news sources are generally way better than online blogs, whenever seemingly the entire internet is talking about something, it generally gets in the news eventually. This can be because individuals create a lot of bots, or just know the places to try to get on their side so that the news will cover it. This is also something to try to be aware of when it comes to misinformation, not everyone needs to know it’s fake for it to spread like wildfire.
<!--  -->
<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This lecture affected how I look at the media and news going forwards. Trying to find the source of a claim or story while generally sticking to mainstream sources is generally a good way to figure out the veracity of a story. Trying to diversify your media diet can be helpful as well, as different people and perspectives can definitely help how you perceive a situation.

When it comes to talks about sensitive topics, I think about things like trans and disability issues, as that's what affects me personally. I also think about how different groups of people are displayed in media, and how that affects others perceive me. The positive representation of trans or mentally disabled people in media directly positively affects how others often interact with me, and a negative representation of people in these groups can hurt people's perception of me. Ya'ke Smith's lecture on Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Justice demonstrates how to show marginalized groups in a positive light.

Ya'ke Smith is the dean of the DEI, which stands for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The organization he is a very important part of is a big pusher for inclusivity and acceptance on campus. They aim to make a more diverse culture on the University of Texas Austin Campus. This alone is amazing but considering this is a part of a communications course this could go one to affect a way larger audience in the future.

Smith talked about how universities are like a world of their own, that eventually affect the world at large in a way that punches above their weight class.

Towards the end, Associate Dean Smith gives some advice moving forwards. He says to try to admit your bias to yourself and think about where you might have gotten said biases from. He then suggests remaining curious, which can help those biases fall away over time. Finally, Smith says to speak out when you see discrimination happening. This is a very important step to me, as someone who's been harassed in the past. I really think the work Ya'ke Smith is doing is very important and will affect the way we approach societal communication.

## Fanvids

### What is a fan?

### What is a fan?
- “One becomes a fan not [just] by being a regular viewer of a particular program but by translating that viewing into some type of cultural activity, by sharing feelings and thoughts about the program content with friends, by joining a community of other fans who share common interests. For fans, consumption sparks production, reading generates writing, until the terms seem logically inseparable.”

- Henry Jenkins, “Star Trek Rerun, Reread, Rewritten: Fan Writing as Textual Poaching,” p. 88

- 2005 - launch of YouTube

### An “Ecology” of Vidding
- “What can a vidder anticipate about how an audience will make sense of her vid? What can she assume, or how can she learn, about the significance her audience will ascribe to particular clips? We are interested not only in the knowledge fans must have in order to interpret a vid, but also in how fans acquire and share that knowledge, because vidders make creative and aesthetic decisions based in part on the readings and interpretations in circulation within a fandom.”
  - Tisha Turk & Joshua Johnson, ​“Toward an Ecology of Vidding”

- meaning-making is collaborative, between audiences and vidders

Lecture 22 � The Vast Wasteland


<p>Last
week, we looked at film in the 1950s: how Hollywood film responded to
television, and how film from outside Hollywood met audience needs for new  
and
different kinds of stories. So, wh
at are
we talking about today? Today we�re
moving ahead to the 1960s, and we�re talking about a man named Newton 
Minow, and we�re talking about our old friend,
television. And what we�ll find is 
 that
in the 60s, maybe not everything is <i>so </i>hunky-dory in TV world, like  
it
was when it first rolled out.</p>
<p>Let�s
pick up with the quiz show scandals. Part
of the problem that led to my pal Herb blowing the whistle was that advertisers
had <i>so much control </i>over programs. Because Revlon was the sole sponsor
of <i>The</i><i> $64,000 Question, </i>they could
force the producers to boot a contestant like Dr. Joyce Brothers if they di 
dn�t
like her. </p>

<p>Once the scandal comes to light,
Congress responds with new legislation that makes it illegal to air phony
competitions. But more important to our
discussion this week is the response from the television industry. They take
back control of their programming. Instead
of a one sponsor/one show model, TV networks sell 30-60 second blocks of time during a program to many different advertisers, loosening the grip any one
company has on a program.</p>

<p> This change gives us a good opportunity to
break down how <i>exactly</i> television makes its money.
</p>

<p>
TV has what we call a dual market
model. <b>[ANIMATION] </b>So you�v 
e got
a television network, right? First of all, they need to sell their programs to audiences.
They need to make great shows <i>and </i>advertise the crapola out of them to
make sure lots of people are parked in front of their televisions, tuned to
their channel at the right time. So, right now literally everything I try to
watch on YouTube has an ad for an upcoming Zoom-based pandemic comedy on NBC that
I would rather eat a bowlful of glass than watch. But the whole point of buying
a bajllion dollars-worth of YouTube ads is to try tobdrum up ratings for this show. The success of this first market is measured 
 in <i>ratings.
</i>Why do they need high ratings?
<b>[ANIMATION] </b>Because they turn
around and sell your eyeballs to advertisers.That�s the second market. The bigger the audience, the more they can 
 charge
advertisers for air timenThat�s why buying a commercial block during the Super Bowl is so expensive: the audience is <i>massive</i>.</p>


<p><b>
New  Mad
Men</b></p>
<p>So, what does this mean in practicality? Well, it means a couple of things. </p>

<p>
First, it means
that TV doesn't make money off of <i>you</i>. Ratings
don't equal money. Networks convert ratings <i>into </i>money by selling your eyeballs to advertisers. Post-quiz show scandals, companies create commercials and branding in ways we're familiar with today the
pithy, one-minute ad; and that's why I've got these great <i>Mad Men </i>gifs,
here.</p>


<p>
In order to charge companies the most money possible for commercial air time,
networks need to build the biggest possible audiences. The answer, for the most
part, is known as lowest common denominator programming. This is programming that doesn�t offend
anyone, isn�t very provocative, but is entertaining enough that a large swa 
th
of people will turn it on. You can get a lot of people to sit in front of
lowest common denominator shows, but the trade-off is that they�re, at best,
sort of blandly amusing.</p>


<p><i>Plenty </i>of shows still fit
this bill today. Think about <i>Law
&amp; Order: SVU. </i>How many of  
us are
willing to plop down in front of an episode of that show if it�s on? Why do you think CNBC can air 12-hour blocks
of <i>Shark Tank</i>? Why do you think
the Food Network creates five different shows that revolve around Guy Fieri?Because they�re <i>fine</i>. They�re FINE. They�re widely relatable, not very controversial shows that are <i>f 
ine</i>. And fine can get you a big ass audience. </p>




<p><b>Clips</b></p>

<p>I'm going to play you a couple of theme songs of shows from the era that sort of
encapsulate lowest common denominator programming. First up, here's <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i>.
<b>[Play clip.] </b>You get the idea Country fish out of water in the big city. </p>

<p>Here�s another one�this is the theme
song to a show called <i>Green Acres</i>. And honestly, I kind of think this theme song slaps, maybe that's just me. <b>[Play clip.]</b></p>

<p>
12.Do you get it?? Look, it�s a <i>city fish </i>out of water in
the <i>country</i>. How did they ever come up with such an incredible, uniq 
ue
story? You can see that these are basically just the same show, just reversed.
There�s something for country people! style 3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>�
There�s something for city people! It�s the universally appealing story
of the fish out of water! There's
something to turn on while you're making dinner, and it''
s
<i>frigging fine</i>.</p>




<p><b>Newton Minow</b></p>


 <p> Enter
the not-so-mild mannered Newton Minow. He�s the
crusading chair of the FCC from 1961 to 1963. He�s appointed by President
Kennedy because he worked on his campaign, and in that capacity Minow and the president�s brother, Robert F. Kennedy,
bonded about how much television their kids watched. It was concerning to the both of them.</p>
<p > So, Minow really
wanted this FCC job, even though he only serves in it for a couple of years.
He�s influential�his whole later career revolves around communications law� 
but these
two years he served with the FCC set a lot of precedents for things we do in
the future. He�s particularly famous for
one speech he gives in 1961, but before we get therelet�s
just recap, like, what is the FCC again? The last time we talked about them was when we were talking about
licensing television stations. So,
 let's
just review for a second.</p>

<p> FCC stands  
for
the Federal Communications Commission. 
They�re an
independent government regulatory agency that answers directly to Congress.
They were
established by the Communications Act of 1934.
They regulate
interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire,
satellite, and cable, including the internet�all stuff that falls under the
federal level of jurisdiction.
And finally,
their functions include licensing stations, analyzing complaints, conducting
investigations, developing regulatory programs, and taking part in hearings</p>



<p>The key thing to remember, just
generally, is that the government decided the airwaves were public, but that
broadcast would be commercial. The vague phrase that works its way into the
legislation was that broadcasters should act in the <i>public interest</i>. 
All of my
foreshadowing about the problematic vagueness of this phrase is about to pay
off.</p>




<p><b>
    Minow</b></p>


<p>
  So,
Minow (wearing a pair of glasses that I would t 
ruly
give my left arm for) addresses this very issue in a speech he gives in 1961; It�s the first major speech  
he
gave as FCC chair, and he delivers it at the convention of the National
Association of Broadcasters�so, basically every television bigwig gathered  
in
one room. And Minow <i>comes in hot</i>.</p>

<p>It�s known  
as the
vast wasteland speech. Historians  
look
back at this speech and see it as signaling that the golden age of televisi 
on
in the 1950s (the era of the anthology drama, of stuff like <i>Twelve Angry
Men)</i> is dead, and that we�ve entered a new era of television that�s hig 
hly
commercial, and kind of mindless.</p>

<p>The key issue of this speech is
public interest vs. commercial imperatives.</p>

>What does TV owe to the public? And what does the public deserve from TV? 

<p>So, he begins by kind of flatt 
ering them. He says: </p>
> <i><b>�Anyone who is in the broadcasting business has a tough row to hoe. You earn your bread by using public property. When you work in broadcasting you volunteer for public service, public pressure, and public regulation. You must compete with other attractions and other investments, and the only way you can do it is to prove to us every three years that you should have been in business in the first place. I can think of easier ways to make a living. But I cannot think of more satisfying ways.� </b></i>
<p>And he agrees that there is <i>some </i>good s 
tuff
on TV�the anthology dramas were good. He also likes <i>The Twilight Zone,</i> me
and Newt have that in common�and Bing Crosby�s specials.
</p>
<p>But then we get
to the famous part, where Newt says tbh, most of
television is hot garbage. He challenges
the broadcasters in the room to sit in front of their own stations for an
entire day with no distractions, and he argues that what they would see is a
vast wasteland of <i>crap</i>.
</p>
<p>
He
says that TV is filled with crud like game shows, formulaic comedies, violent
westerns, and cartoons that are <i>chock full </i>of commercials that are
pitched right at our kids' tender little brains. And at the time, cartoons like
the Flintstones are selling Winston Salem cigarettes, so kids are truly seeing
all kinds of wild ads. And that is the crux of his argument that TV isn't just
brainless, it's constantly trying to sell you stuff, and that's a toxic combo.</p>




<p><b> Minow
 in control  
room </b></p>


<p>
So, he points out that broadcasters are using the <i>public </i>airwave 
s,
which are a public resource, and because of that, programming should serve  
the
public interest. He sees himself a 
s a
representative of the people. He�s fighting to get them better shows.?</p>


<p><b>Six
principles</b></p>
<p>He lays out six principles in his speech.</p>
1. First, the people own the air. 
2. Second, that they need to move beyond the quiz show scandals and deal with bigger problems�that legislation didn�t do anything to address the quality of TV programming. 
3. Third, he says we should <i>not </i>nationalize the broadcast system. He believes in free enterprise and is committed to our commercial model. 
4. Fourth: the government and broadcasters need to pull together
to address the lack of educational options on TV.
5. Fifth, he promises that the government is not going to censor what broadcasters show he's not going to
start blacking out <i>Green Acres</i> because it's  stupid but he <i>is </i>going to take his job seriously, because squandering
the airwaves is squandering a limited public resource.





 Pause

<p>So,
we're going to pause for a second and do a little thinking exercise.Imagine that you are
    Newton Minow, wearing that fabulous pair of glasses. What kinds of programs do you think <i>should </i>be on the air</p>
>What would a program that serves the public interest look like?What would it talk about?What�s missing from the 1960s commercial television landscape?

<p>Now, take a 
nother
moment and imagine that you are one of those TV fat cats sitting in the audience, and you are like �TV is <i>just fine</i> the way it is.� </p>
> How could you argue that commercial TV is valuable? How do shows like <i>Green Acres  </i>and <i>The Flintstones </i>and other lowest common denominator shows<i> </i>servethe public interest?




<p class 3DMsoNormal><b> style 3D'font-size:12.0pfont-family:"Times  
New  Programming
in the public interest</b></p>


 <p>Here�s
what Minow suggests. Later in his speech, he la 
ys out
a few characteristics he thinks belong to television that serves the public
interest. He says it should have � 
a soul
and a conscience,� that it should build character, citizenship, and intelle 
ct,
that it should �ring with intelligence and leadership,� that it should make 
 our
people aware of the world, and that it should enlarge the capacities of our
children. Nodding to the interests 
 of
the broadcasters in that room, he argues that television can do two things  
at
once: it can communicate ideas as well as relaxation.
style 3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>� He�s saying we should have shows that make you a better thinker, a better citizen, and
a better person, in addition to just letting you unwind.</p>

 <p>At the end of the day, he sees
himself as coming to the public�s defense.He�s saying that people are not as stupid as television seems to think
they are <b>[ANIMATION] </b>He says <i>�It is not enough to cater to the
nation�s whims; you must also serve the nation�s needs. And I would add thi 
s:
that if some of you persist in a relentless search for the highest rating a 
nd
the lowest common denominator, you may very well lose your audience</i>.�And he <i>does </i>sort of have a point 
, if
you think about what�s happening in the film industry at the time. You�re
seeing the rise of arthouse cinema because there�s a big enough chunk of the
public that�s sick to death of the Pablum that Hollywood keeps putting out. 
 He�s
saying there�s a floor to the stupid shit people 
 will
watch�although I�m not sure Minow could have
predicted they�d try to make a show out of the Geico caveman commercials, so, who knows.</p>




<p><b> Commercial
imperative</b></p>


  Let�s
take a look at his argument from the opposite si 
de,
though. What�s the commercial
imperative? Why <i>don�t </i>netwo 
rks
serve the public interest? </p>



style 3D'mso-tab-count:1'>����������� <b>[ANIMATION] </b>Here are a  
few
problems. Networks are subject to the demands of advertisers, and because t 
hey
make money  class 3DGramE>off of advertising, they need to buil 
d the
biggest audience possible. There are a finite number of people, eyeballs, a 
nd
television sets in the country, so they  class 3DGramE>have to
compete with each other for ratings. style 3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>�
They know that if they suddenly opt to air lectures about art histor 
y at
8pm on Wednesdays, audiences not into that kind of programming will simply
flock to a competitor showing something more entertaining.
style 3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>� They also argue that the public has exp 
ressed
an interest for the so-called �bad� shows  Minow 
 is
pooping on, and that they serve the public interest by providing those show 
s. </p>



style 3D'mso-tab-count:1'>����������� They also question whether edu 
cating
the public is really their job. style 3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>�
Newspapers, libraries, schools, and colleges exist for that reason.  
Is
it really on private entertainment corporations to educate the nation�s
children?</p>



<p> At the end  
of the
day, the commercial imperative means that <i>profit </i>is the number one g 
oal
of television broadcasters. To the extent that profit and public interest a 
re
in conflict, broadcasters in a commercial system will always choose profit! 
 It
is literally their job. Educating  
kids
is certainly a worthy goal, but if you expect a corporation to do that inst 
ead
of maximizing their earnings, you�re nuts.</p>




<p><b>SS
 Minow</b></p>



 <p>So,
some people agree with  Minow. Other people say  
that
he�s an elitist snob and he should keep his grubby mitts of their shows and 
 let
them watch <i>Green Acres </i>in peace. Commercial television corporations  
are
kind of like�whatever, Newt. </p>

<p>but there�s also this kind of
apocryphal story�I�ve never seen any proof it, but it bounces around media
studies classes and I�ve been taught the story, so <i>why not </i>repeat
it? If you�re not familiar with th 
e show
<i>Gilligan�s Island, </i>it�s a dopey show from the 1960s about a bunch of
people who get stuck on a desert island. The boat that crashes is called the
S.S. Minnow, and there�s a rumor that it was named after Newton Minow as kind of a dig. </p>

<p>
So, in some ways he fails to get the
networks to change their kinds of programming.</p>





<p><b> Presidential
Medal of Freedom</b></p>

he is remembered for a few things.
>The
vast wasteland speech does resonate with a lot of people, and it inspires s 
ome
folks to think in new ways about what television might do to serve the Amer 
ican
public�particularly American children. We�ll revisit that next week. 


<p>He also clears the way for
communications satellites, which lays a crucial technological infrastructure
for�almost everything we do today? </p>

<p class 3DMsoNormal style 3D'text-indent:.5in'> style 3D'font-size:12 
.0p
He also helped pass�and this is going  
to
sound a little finicky and inside  class 3DGramE>baseball, but  
stick
with me�the All Channel Receiver Act in 1961. Remember when we talked about
that old Zenith commercial, <i>Fog Over Portland</i>, which was extremely
melodramatic about their televisions getting both UHF and VHF channels? <o: 
p></o:p></p>


 <p>Well, Min 
ow�s
legislation made it so all televisions sold in the US had to get both kinds 
of
channels. And UHF stations are whe 
re a
lot of <i>public</i> stations begin to broadcast, and where our earliest
educational programs lived. This seemingly very technology-focused act in f 
act
helps to get more kids more educational programs.</p>



<p class 3DMsoNormal><b> Final
Quote</b></p>


 <p>And
Newt is actually still with us! He�s still kicki 
ng at 94; He gave an interview to <i>Ad  
Age </i>back
in 2011, on the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his famous speech, and they
asked whether he thought television was still such a vast wasteland. <o:p>< 
/o:p></p>

<p>Minow says
that the argument he was truly making was about <i>choice</i>. He never wan 
ted
to censor bad shows, but he was concerned that in the 1960s, when most peop 
le
got just three or four channels, there were no other options. There wasn�t  
an
alternative for folks looking for more educational shows for themselves or
their kids. And he argues that it�s a very different environment now, and
that�s probably a pretty good thing. style 3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>�
People have hundreds of channels at their disposal, both very educat 
ional
and very not, but a larger smorgasbord of programming is all he really ever wanted.</p>
<p>He also makes
this very prescient observation. He says that the flipside of all that choi 
ce
is that perhaps we�ve lost a �common shared experience� through
television. When we gain endless choice
in programming�particularly in news programming�people can always find a
presentation of current events that cements their already existing world
view. And, nine years later, we se 
e this argument all the time�that filter bubbles, algorithms, cable news, and other
aspects of our endless media buffet contribute to the polarization of opini 
ons.
He says there might have been something valuable to everyone watching Walter
Cronkite deliver the news of the day.</p>


<p>Obviously, that�s something that�s very
much up for debate. People fall on all sides of this argument�I sometimes t 
hink
different things about this depending on what�s going on in the world. But  
it�s
something that�s interesting to consider, and it�s particularly interesting
coming from a man who was deeply concerned with what television could do for
us, the viewers, and our democracy.</p>

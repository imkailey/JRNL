# Lecture 23: 60s TV and Social Change, Pt. 1

## Donna Reed

<p>Let’s start here, with a show that we didn’t watch, but one that you might have heard of or seen 
parodied or mocked by more recent shows.  If we think back to what we learned over the last 
couple of weeks, there is no more quintessentially 1950s media than The Donna Reed Show. This 
was a very light domestic comedy, much like Father Knows Best, and it was famous for the 
mom, Donna, vacuuming and preparing meals in full makeup, a puffy skirt, heels, and pearls.</p>

<p>This show and these televised images of idealized families don’t reflect the  reality of 
1950s life—which is always more diverse and more complicated than TV will admit—but this is 
the image the nation is trying to project of itself. We are middle-class, white, suburban, thriving 
consumers; we love to go to the store and buy all the wonderful products we see on television, 
and fill our detached suburban homes with wonderful new stuff.  Mom’s a homemaker, dad’s the 
breadwinner, our kids are these chipper examples of humanity.</p>

<p>The Donna Reed Show debuts toward the end of the 1950s, but keep this image in your 
mind as our starting point.  It’s hard to express how profoundly social movements reshaped U.S. 
culture in the 1960s. Let’s see how far we get from Donna Reed with just a few images of 
change in the ensuing decade.</p>
## Cultural movements in the 60s

### Jackie O.

<p>In 1963, President John F. Kennedy is assassinated, an event of national mourning and upset.</p>

### MLK & Coretta Scott King
<p> Across the era, civil rights protesters demand racial equity.  This is an image from the Selma to 
Montgomery march in 1965, but Black protestors across the decade used sit-ins, boycotts, and 
other methods, building on decades of earlier Black activism. We’re going to talk more in the 
next lecture about how nonfiction television media like the news covers anti-racist protests, but 
for now, just think about how this movement is pressing for social change.</p>

### Counterculture
There’s a youth movement known as **the counterculture that grows throughout the 1960s,** and 
with it comes **new values, new aesthetics, new art, new social and cultural practices, and new
ways of living.**  It may have hit its height during the so-called Summer of Love in 1967—and 
here’s a photo of the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco that sort of exemplifies that hippie 
spirit—but their impact on U.S. culture continues to reverberate throughout the 60s and on for 
many years after.

### Vietnam

**That youth movement was powered by and connected to anti-war protests of the 1960**s.  Here, 
you see a photo of the enormous March on Washington in October of 1967, when more than a 
hundred thousand people came to the National Mall to protest the Vietnam War.

### Freedom Trash Can

<p>Second Wave feminism is usually associated more with the 1970s, but it gets its start in the** 
1960s, and it rejects everything Donna Reed stood for.**  Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique 
is published in the early part of the decade; it’s an influential book that decries the isolation and 
sadness of the housewife.  And protests outside the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City 
reject the objectification of women by the media. </

</p>

<p>Incidentally, this is where rumors about feminists burning their bras started.  The women 
had a “freedom trash can” where women were encouraged to throw in things like girdles, heels, 
and other uncomfortable trappings of feminine presentation.  However, they weren’t allowed to 
light it on fire. So, no bras were actually harmed in the making of this protest, despite the rumor.</p>

### Gay rights

The gay rights movement exploded after police raided the **Stonewall Inn,** a gay bar in New York 
City, **in June of 1969**.  Here, you see Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two trans women of 
color who led the fight for queer rights that night at the Stonewall, and for many years after.

### Woodstock

And while some people might think of Woodstock as the defining image of the 1960s—you 
know, peace, love, hippies, and music…

### Altamont

<p>…it’s important to remember that the decade actually came to a close here, at Altamont, in 
December 1969.  This was a West Coast rock festival that ended in tragedy, when Hells Angels 
murdered a young Black concertgoer.

</p>

<p>So, the 1960s is a decade that takes us from Donna Reed through the rise and collapse of 
    a utopian youth movement, with countless revolutions in between.</p>

### Newton

<p>So, for the purposes of this class, we need to understand how all of this roiling social change is 
    reflected in the media of the era, and how it changes the media of the era.</p>

<p>So remember, the 1960s are the time of ol’ Newton Minow’s wasteland, 
right?  Shows like Gilligan’s Island  or The Beverly Hillbillies are what’s on the 
    air.</p>

### Quote

<p>So,  today’s lecture is going to address how these mainstream, or lowest 
common denominator, entertainment programs begin to address the revolutionary social change 
of the 1960s. How do all of these different movements, protests, and revolutions, and all of their 
attendant beliefs, begin to creep into shows that were designed to please everyone, not push the 
envelope?

</p>



## I’ve got four examples for you.

### Star Trek 

#### 1. The first is Star Trek, which began in 1966 and only runs until 1969 in this, the first incarnation of the franchise.

#### Quote
> And this was its mission: exploration, peacekeeping, and contact with others.  That’s sort of the 
spirit of the whole show.  Its creator, Gene Roddenberry, had a very specific vision of the future, 
and that vision sort of functions as a response to the civil rights movement.

#### Sulu
<p>The fictional crew of the starship Enterprise was racially integrated. Rodenberry had this vision 
that in the future we would be open, and tolerant. It made sense to him that hundreds of years in 
the future, we would live in a world where people of different races and different genders 
worked side by side. </p>

<p>Here is national treasure George Takei as Lt. Sulu—and while this doesn’t specifically 
have to do with the 1960s, Takei is generally a fascinating person. In the years after Star Trek he 
became an out, gay icon, and he also spoke about his experience as a boy in a Japanese 
internment camp here in the United States. </p>

#### Spock
Here is Spock, who’s played by Leonard Nimoy—who is a white actor.  But the character of 
Spock is half human and half Vulcan, a kind of alien in the Star Trek universe.  Symbolically, 
Spock becomes this bi-racial character.  The show couches this symbolism in science-fiction—
so, it’s not an overt message about race. But several episodes (including the one you will watch 
for this week) depict Spock navigating between two cultures and two parts of his identity.

#### Nichelle Nichols
<p>And I want to dwell here for a moment with Nichelle Nichols, who played communications 
officer Lt. Uhura.  In 1966, when the show premiered, a little over 3% of speaking roles in 
primetime television shows went to Black actors, and it was even worse in ads—only .65% of 
speaking roles in commercials were given to Black performers.  There was virtually no 
representation of Black women in professional roles.</p>
<p> <b>Because of this absolute dearth of representation for Black women, Nichols saw playing 
    Uhura as more than just an acting gig.</b>  She did not take lightly the chance to embody this 
professional woman of the future, even though she was predominantly a theater actress and her 
passion lay outside science fiction television.  She was thinking of leaving the show to go take a 
starring role on Broadway, and that’s where the interview I’ve asked you to watch picks up. 
There’s a very moving reason why she ends up staying with Star Trek through its whole run. </p>




#### Kiss
<p>Nichols is famous for a 1968 episode of the show called “Plato’s Stepchildren,” which includes 
the first romantic interracial kiss on American television between Uhura and Captain Kirk, 
    played by William Shatner.</p>

​	Nichols wrote about this event in her autobiography.  She said that  

> “…[the episode] received a huge response. We received one of the largest batches of fan mail 
> ever, all of it very positive, with many addressed to me from girls wondering how it felt to kiss 
> Captain Kirk, and many to him from guys wondering the same thing about me. However, almost 
> no one found the kiss offensive" except from a single, mildly negative letter from one white 
> Southerner who wrote: "I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a 
> red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like 
> Uhura,  he ain't gonna fight it."

#### Star Trek images
<p>Now, let’s be honest: Star Trek wasn’t perfect.  Star Trek included a species of alien, the Orion 
women, who were basically just green burlesque dancers. Captain Kirk seduced his sweaty way 
across the Universe.  

#### Uniforms
The women in the future wear extremely tiny skirts and gogo boots while the men get sensible 
athleisure. Uhura is often presented as the telephone operator of the Enterprise rather than an 
equal to her male colleagues.  All of this is true. But if we are looking for ways that the ethics of 
the civil rights movement were beginning to shift mainstream television shows, it’s visible—if 
limited—when you look at Star Trek’s integrated and somewhat egalitarian vision of the future.

### Bewitched
<p> Our second example of how mainstream shows incorporated civil rights discourse is Bewitched, 
which ran from 1964 to 1972. And this show is a domestic comedy not unlike those of the 1950s, 
however, the twist is that Samantha, the wife, is a witch.  This tilts the scales of power in the 
idealized mid-century suburban home.  Samantha has virtually limitless power, so she’s 
technically the one in control, but that power is still subject to the gender ideology of the era.  If 
she was really so powerful, why not just zap her ding dong of a husband to the moon when he 
    brings his boss home for dinner unannounced?</p>
<p> So, this is an interesting example of how civil rights discourse begins to bleed into 
mainstream television because it does so in some really weird ways.  We’re going to take a quick 
    look at two episodes.</p>



#### The Witches Are Out

<p> The first is a 1964 episode called The Witches Are Out, in which Samantha hates Halloween 
because it gives people a terrible image of what witches are.  They aren’t all old child-eating 
crones with warty noses.  Her aforementioned ding dong of a husband, Darren, is an ad guy and 
he’s working on this Halloween candy account.  His client wants him to use an ugly witch in the 
ad campaign, and Samantha is livid.  They get in this fight that’s sort of a coded way of talking 
about race and representation.
	<p> She says: </p>

</p>

“You of all people, you should know better!  That’s the kind 
of thing we’re trying to fight.  That picture.  It’s offensive.  Is that how you think I look?” Darren 
rolls his eyes at this, saying that since most people don’t even believe in witches so it’s okay to 
discriminate against them. 

​	 <p>She continues to argue: 

“How would you like it if you were always 
being represented as something different?” after which she calls him flat-out prejudiced, even 
bigoted.
	 Darren responds, "If I were prejudiced, I wouldn't've married you would 
I?" 

#### Protest Sign

<p>So, Darren eventually relents and uses a modern-looking witch in the ad, but he’s fired for doing 
so. In response, Samantha and her witch friends invade the candy guy’s dreams, turning him into 
an ugly witch as revenge, and then staging a protest where they hold up signs like this, that say 
“Witches are people too!”  

</p>

<p>Not unlike the example of Spock, what you see here is a white actor written in such a 
way that she has to negotiate multiple identities that are treated by the show in a racialized way.  
On this Bewitched episode, you even see them incorporate the language of prejudice and 
symbols of anti-racist protest.  So again—the civil rights movement bleeds into the show, but 
here it’s treated completely metaphorically.  And I think you can make compelling arguments 
that this might advance the cause to audiences otherwise unwilling to entertain the idea of racial 
equity, but also dilutes that cause by freeing it of any sign of Blackness.

#### Sisters at Heart

A 1970 episode of Bewitched discusses racial equality more explicitly, and that’s because it 
wasn’t just written by the regular writing staff.  Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old teacher at a 
predominantly Black high school found that her students were struggling with literacy. They 
don’t like to read because they’ve been underserved by their educators, but they do love 
storytelling in the form of television.  So, she reaches out to every show her students watch to see 
if they could arrange some kind of visit or project with her students, and Bewitched is the only 
show that responds.  They pay to have the class come visit the studio and this group of 10th grade 
English students writes the story for this episode, called Sisters at Heart. 
	The story involves Tabitha, the little baby witch of the family, and her non-witchy friend, 
who is Black.  The girls love each other so much they want to be sisters, so Tabitha keeps 
changing their skin color. Throughout the course of the episode, an explicitly racist character 
comes to see the error of his ways.  
	Now.  By current standards, how progressive is this? It definitely skirts the line of 
blackface, and it’s also a very sentimental, pat treatment of racism and inequality. As an artifact 
of its era, though, it’s an interesting experiment in what kinds of stories Black students wanted 
their shows to tell.

### Twilight Zone

Our third example is one of my all time favorite shows, The Twilight Zone, which ran from 1959 
to 1964.  So, we’re not going chronologically—this was on the air a little bit earlier than the 
other shows we’ve talked about so far.  The show was only a moderate success at the time, 
despite it being one of Newton Minow’s favorites.  It was cancelled three times! 
	If you’ve never seen the show before, many of the episodes kind of walk the line between 
science-fiction and horror, and if anything it’s famous for having a twist in many of the 
episodes—like, something you didn’t see coming. Most of the episodes also have a strong moral, 
or a lesson you should learn.
	This show doesn’t so much reflect civil rights discourse as it does critique the dominant 
social and political climate of the era. 

1.	It critiques the danger of the Cold War by problematizing space and the space race.
2.	It critiques the paranoia of Cold War-era fearmongering about Communists in the 
U.S.
3.	It critiques the supposed perfection of those 1950s suburbs.
Cold War
So, just to take a quick detour…what was the Cold War, again?  Well, it was an era of tension 
between the US and the USSR that manifested geopolitically in the forms of a nuclear arms race, 
the space race, military standoffs, and so forth. 
	It also had a cultural impact within the United States in the form of increased paranoia 
about Communists.  Communists, according to Senator Joseph McCarthy, could be anywhere. 
They could be everywhere. A mania for naming and rooting out suspected Communists wherever 
they may be, including in Hollywood, came to be known as McCarthyism. 

#### Rod Serling

So, Rod Serling is the brains behind The Twilight Zone and the pen behind its most full-throated 
critiques of Cold War politics. Serling graduated from high school during WWII and became a 
military paratrooper.  He was stationed in the Philippines and in Japan and saw lots and lots of 
death during his time there. He had flashbacks and nightmares about the war for the rest of his 
life.  You can see this in his writing, which often dwells on themes like the arbitrariness of life 
and death, and memory, and hate, and trauma.
	He began working in radio when he was at Antioch College on the GI bill, and he moved 
to television during the golden age of TV dramas in the 1950s.  He was a prolific teleplay writer 
and also a vocal critic of sponsor control and censorship of programs by advertisers.  Talking 
about a political drama he wrote for Studio One, he said  "I was not permitted to 
have my senators discuss any current or pressing problem. To talk of tariff was to align oneself 
with the Republicans; to talk of labor was to suggest control by the Democrats. To say a single 
thing germane to the current political scene was absolutely prohibited."
	It was because of his beliefs about censorship that he maintained the strictest of creative 
control over The Twilight Zone. He writes 92 of the 156 episodes himself over five years and 
finds that, through allegory and genre, he has a clear path to comment on the ills of Cold War 
politics and paranoia—and your reading for this lecture addresses this.
	Let’s look at a couple of themes.

#### Invaders

This is a still from the 1961 episode “The Invaders,” which you’ll watch for this week’s 
screening.  This and other episodes like it ask what it means for us to go to space—to compete so 
voraciously with other countries to do so, and to become not just Americans, but Earthlings, we 
leave the planet. Serling uses stories of space, told from different perspectives, to make us think 
about what it meant to be human, and how we should behave.  You’ll see that in “The Invaders,” 
which I also love because it has virtually no dialog.  You’ll see some of the legacy of silent film 
in this show.

#### Who can you trust?

In the early 1960s, Hollywood was still working through the blacklists of the 1950s—when 
prominent industry figures were accused of being Communist sympathizers and then exiled from 
the business. And paranoia among regular people of some political orientations about the spread 
of Communism was still a compelling social force, particularly as the tensions that led to the 
Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 heightened.  
	The Twilight Zone comments on these social conditions by dramatizing over and over 
again the story of us vs. them. How do we know you’re one of us?  And how do we protect 
ourselves if you’re not. Episodes like “Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?” in 1962 both tell 
the story of us vs. them and interrogate the impulse to mistrust everyone you see. 
In this episode, a bus gets stuck in a storm and the passengers have to figure out why 
there are more people getting off the bus at this little diner than got on.  Weird occurrences 
happen.  Who is the infiltrator?  And why?

#### Suburbs

Finally, instead of depicting the suburbs as this idyllic place seen on shows like Father Knows 
Best, you know, Eden with a split-level ranch, the suburbs of The Twilight Zone are often the site 
of fear, alienation, phoniness, anger, prejudice, and suspicion.  
In “Stopover in a Quiet Town,” the couple seen here wakes up from a hangover in a town 
where they seem to be the only residents.  They realize throughout the course of the episode that 
literally everything around them is fabricated—it’s fake.  

#### Beatlemania

Our final example isn’t exactly like the other ones, because I’m talking about a fan movement, 
not a show.  But the rapturous, full-bodied fandom of teen girls wild for the Beatles was put on 
full display on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964—which was just about as mainstream a show as 
you could get—and their screaming and writhing and crying helped hint at the changing gender 
politics of the 1960s.

### Ed Sullivan

So, more than 73 million Americans tuned in to watch the Beatles make their stateside television 
debut on Ed Sullivan in 1964.  Commenters and journalists of the time had already been 
describing Beatles’ concerts as “orgiastic” because they were full of young women shrieking and 
drooling and fainting and sweating and throwing their bodies at these young men.

#### Quote 1

> Writer Barbara Erenreich and some others looked back at Beatlemania 
> and saw it not quite as an organized protest movement, but still the “first mass outburst of the 
> ‘60s to feature women—in this case girls, who would not reach full adulthood until the ‘70s—
> and the emergence of a genuinely political movement for women’s liberation.”  So, it wasn’t a 
> protest per se, but through their expressive Beatles fandom, women and girls got to slip the 
> handcuffs of mid-century gender ideologies.

#### Quote 2

> The quote continues: “The screaming 10-to-14-year-old fans of 1964 did not riot for anything, 
> except the chance to remain in the proximity of their idols and hence to remain screaming. But 
> they did have plenty to riot against, or at least to overcome through the act of rioting: …teen and 
> preteen girls were expected to be not only ‘good’ and ‘pure’ but to be the enforcers of purity 
> within their teen society—drawing the line for overeager boys and ostracizing girls who failed in 
> this responsibility.

#### Quote 3

> “To abandon control—to scream, faint, dash about in mobs—was, in form if not in conscious 
> intent, to protest the sexual repressiveness, the rigid double standard of female teen culture. It 
> was the first and most dramatic uprising of women’s sexual revolution.”

<p> What this means is that being a Beatles fan gave girls and young women the momentary 
right to express sexual desire and inhabit their bodies in ways that were normally unacceptable or 
unladylike—and on February 9, 1964, they brought all that unbridled sexual energy to the set of 
    the most middle-of-the-road family variety show you could get. </p>

## Conclusion
<p><b> So, from Star Trek to Ed Sullivan, we do not see an overt discussion of changing social 
norms. And yet, in oblique and coded ways, even these lowest common denominator shows 
    began to whisper to its audience about what was happening in the streets.	</b></p>

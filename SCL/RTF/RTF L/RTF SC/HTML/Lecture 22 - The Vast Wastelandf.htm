<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Last
week, we looked at film in the 1950s: how Hollywood film responded to
television, and how film from outside Hollywood met audience needs for new and
different kinds of stories.  So, what are we talking about today?  Today we’re
moving ahead to the 1960s, and we’re talking about a man named Newton Minow,
and we’re talking about our old friend, television.  And what we’ll find is
that in the 60s, maybe not everything is <i>so </i>hunky-dory in TV world, like
it was when it first rolled out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Key
Terms</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Here
are your key terms for this lecture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Dual
Market Model</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Let’s
pick up with the quiz show scandals.  Part of the problem that led to my pal
Herb blowing the whistle was that advertisers had <i>so much control </i>over
programs. Because Revlon was the sole sponsor of <i>The $64,000 Question, </i>they
could force the producers to boot a contestant like Dr. Joyce Brothers if they
didn’t like her. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Once
the scandal comes to light, Congress responds with new legislation that makes
it illegal to air phony competitions.  But more important to our discussion
this week is the response from the television industry. They take back control
of their programming.  Instead of a one sponsor/one show model, TV networks
sell 30-60 second blocks of time during a program to many different advertisers,
loosening the grip any one company has on a program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> This change gives us a good opportunity
to break down how <i>exactly</i> television makes its money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            TV
has what we call a dual market model.  <b>[ANIMATION] </b>So you’ve got a
television network, right?  First of all, they need to sell their programs to
audiences. They need to make great shows <i>and </i>advertise the crapola out
of them to make sure lots of people are parked in front of their televisions,
tuned to their channel at the right time. So, right now literally everything I
try to watch on YouTube has an ad for an upcoming Zoom-based pandemic comedy on
NBC that I would rather eat a bowlful of glass than watch. But the whole point
of buying a bajllion dollars-worth of YouTube ads is to try to drum up ratings
for this show. The success of this first market is measured in <i>ratings. </i> Why
do they need high ratings?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>Because they turn around and sell your eyeballs to advertisers.  That’s the
second market. The bigger the audience, the more they can charge advertisers
for air time.  That’s why buying a commercial block during the Super Bowl is so
expensive: the audience is <i>massive</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Mad
Men</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So,
what does this mean in practicality?  Well, it means a couple of things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>First, it means that TV doesn’t make money off of <i>you</i>. Ratings don’t
equal money. Networks convert ratings <i>into </i>money by selling your
eyeballs to advertisers. Post-quiz show scandals, companies have to create
commercials and branding in ways we’re familiar with today—the pithy,
one-minute ad—and that’s why I’ve got these great <i>Mad Men </i>gifs, here. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In
order to charge companies the most money possible for commercial air time,
networks need to build the biggest possible audiences. The answer, for the most
part, is known as “lowest common denominator” programming.  This is programming
that doesn’t offend anyone, isn’t very provocative, but is entertaining enough
that a large swath of people will turn it on. You can get a lot of people to
sit in front of lowest common denominator shows, but the trade-off is that
they’re, at best, sort of blandly amusing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <i>Plenty
</i>of shows still fit this bill today.  Think about <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU.  </i>How
many of us are willing to plop down in front of an episode of that show if it’s
on?  Why do you think CNBC can air 12-hour blocks of <i>Shark Tank</i>?  Why do
you think the Food Network creates five different shows that revolve around Guy
Fieri?  Because they’re <i>fine</i>.  They’re FINE.  They’re widely relatable,
not very controversial shows that are <i>fine</i>. And fine can get you a big
ass audience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Clips</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I’m
going to play you a couple of theme songs of shows from the era that sort of
encapsulate lowest common denominator programming.  First up, here’s <i>The
Beverly Hillbillies</i>. <b>[Play clip.] </b>You get the idea.  Country fish
out of water in the big city. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Here’s
another one—this is the theme song to a show called <i>Green Acres</i>.  And
honestly, I kind of think this theme song slaps, but, I dunno, maybe that’s
just me. <b>[Play clip.]</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            </span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Do you get it?? 
Look, it’s a <i>city fish </i>out of water in the <i>country</i>. How did they
ever come up with such an incredible, unique story? You can see that these are
basically just the same show, just reversed. There’s something for country
people!  There’s something for city people! It’s the universally appealing
story of the fish out of water!  There’s something to turn on while you’re
making dinner, and it’s <i>frigging fine</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Newton
Minow</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Enter
the not-so-mild mannered Newton Minow. He’s the crusading chair of the FCC from
1961 to 1963. He’s appointed by President Kennedy because he worked on his
campaign, and in that capacity Minow and the president’s brother, Robert F.
Kennedy, bonded about how much television their kids watched. It was concerning
to the both of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So Minow really wanted this FCC job, even
though he only serves in it for a couple of years. He’s influential—his whole
later career revolves around communications law—but these two years he served
with the FCC set a lot of precedents for things we do in the future.  He’s
particularly famous for one speech he gives in 1961, but before we get there…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>FCC</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>…let’s
just recap, like, what is the FCC again?  The last time we talked about them
was when we were talking about licensing television stations.  So, let’s just
review for a second. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>FCC stands for the Federal Communications Commission. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>They’re an independent government regulatory agency that answers directly
to Congress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>They were established by the Communications Act of 1934.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>They regulate interstate and international communications by radio,
television, wire, satellite, and cable, including the internet—all stuff that
falls under the federal level of jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>And finally, their functions include licensing stations, analyzing
complaints, conducting investigations, developing regulatory programs, and
taking part in hearings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
key thing to remember, just generally, is that the government decided the
airwaves were public, but that broadcast would be commercial. The vague phrase
that works its way into the legislation was that broadcasters should act in the
<i>public interest</i>.  All of my foreshadowing about the problematic
vagueness of this phrase is about to pay off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Minow</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So,
Minow (wearing a pair of glasses that I would truly give my left arm for)
addresses this very issue in a speech he gives in 1961.  It’s the first major
speech he gave as FCC chair, and he delivers it at the convention of the
National Association of Broadcasters—so, basically every television bigwig
gathered in one room. And Minow <i>comes in hot</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>It’s known as the vast wasteland speech.  Historians look back at this
speech and see it as signaling that the golden age of television in the 1950s
(the era of the anthology drama, of stuff like <i>Twelve Angry Men)</i> is dead,
and that we’ve entered a new era of television that’s highly commercial, and
kind of mindless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
key issue of this speech is public interest vs. commercial imperatives.  What
does TV owe to the public? And what does the public deserve from TV? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            So,
he begins by kind of flattering them.  He says: <i>“Anyone who is in the
broadcasting business has a tough row to hoe. You earn your bread by using
public property. When you work in broadcasting you volunteer for public
service, public pressure, and public regulation. You must compete with other
attractions and other investments, and the only way you can do it is to prove
to us every three years that you should have been in business in the first
place. I can think of easier ways to make a living. But I cannot think of more
satisfying ways.”<b> </b></i>And he agrees that there is <i>some </i>good stuff
on TV—the anthology dramas were good. He also likes <i>The Twilight Zone</i>—me
and Newt have that in common—and Bing Crosby’s specials.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>But then we get to the famous part, where Newt says tbh, most of television
is hot garbage.  He challenges the broadcasters in the room to sit in front of
their own stations for an entire day with no distractions, and he argues that
what they would see is a vast wasteland of <i>crap</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Minow
(new quote)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[ANIMATION]
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He
says that TV is filled with crud like game shows, formulaic comedies, violent
westerns, and cartoons that are <i>chock full </i>of commercials that are
pitched right at our kids’ tender little brains. And at the time, cartoons like
the Flintstones are selling Winston Salem cigarettes, so kids are truly seeing
all kinds of wild ads. And that is the crux of his argument—that TV isn’t just
brainless, it’s constantly trying to sell you stuff, and that’s a toxic combo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Minow
in control room</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[<b>ANIMATION]
</b>So, he points out that broadcasters are using the <i>public </i>airwaves,
which are a public resource, and because of that, programming should serve the
public interest.  He sees himself as a representative of the people. He’s
fighting to get them better shows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Six
principles</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He
lays out six principles in his speech.  First, the people own the air.  Second,
that they need to move beyond the quiz show scandals and deal with bigger
problems—that legislation didn’t do anything to address the quality of TV
programming. Third, he says we should <i>not </i>nationalize the broadcast
system. He believes in free enterprise and is committed to our commercial
model. Fourth: the government and broadcasters need to pull together to address
the lack of educational options on TV.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Fifth,
he promises that the government is not going to censor what broadcasters
show—he’s not going to start blacking out <i>Green Acres</i> because it’s hella
stupid—but he <i>is </i>going to take his job seriously, because squandering
the airwaves is squandering a limited public resource.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Pause</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So,
we’re going to pause for a second and do a little thinking exercise.  <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>Imagine that you are Newton Minow, wearing that fabulous pair of glasses. 
What kinds of programs do you think <i>should </i>be on the air?  What would a
program that serves the public interest look like?  What would it talk about? 
What’s missing from the 1960s commercial television landscape?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>Now, take another moment and imagine that you are one of those TV fat cats
sitting in the audience, and you are like “TV is <i>just fine</i> the way it
is.” How could you argue that commercial TV is valuable? How do shows like <i>Green
Acres </i>and <i>The Flintstones </i>and other lowest common denominator shows<i>
</i>serve the public interest? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Take
a second to think about this, and come on back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Programming
in the public interest</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Here’s
what Minow suggests. Later in his speech, he lays out a few characteristics he
thinks belong to television that serves the public interest.  He says it should
have “a soul and a conscience,” that it should build character, citizenship,
and intellect, that it should “ring with intelligence and leadership,” that it
should make our people aware of the world, and that it should enlarge the
capacities of our children.  Nodding to the interests of the broadcasters in
that room, he argues that television can do two things at once: it can
communicate ideas as well as relaxation.  He’s saying we should have shows that
make you a better thinker, a better citizen, and a better person, in addition
to just letting you unwind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            At
the end of the day, he sees himself as coming to the public’s defense.  He’s
saying that people are not as stupid as television seems to think they are <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>He says <i>“It is not enough to cater to the nation’s whims; you must also
serve the nation’s needs. And I would add this: that if some of you persist in
a relentless search for the highest rating and the lowest common denominator,
you may very well lose your audience</i>.”  And he <i>does </i>sort of have a
point, if you think about what’s happening in the film industry at the time.
You’re seeing the rise of arthouse cinema because there’s a big enough chunk of
the public that’s sick to death of the pablum that Hollywood keeps putting out.
He’s saying there’s a floor to the stupid shit people will watch—although I’m
not sure Minow could have predicted they’d try to make a show out of the Geico
caveman commercials, so, who knows. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Commercial
imperative</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Let’s
take a look at his argument from the opposite side, though.  What’s the
commercial imperative?  Why <i>don’t </i>networks serve the public interest? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>Here are a few problems. Networks are subject to the demands of
advertisers, and because they make money off of advertising, they need to build
the biggest audience possible. There are a finite number of people, eyeballs,
and television sets in the country, so they have to compete with each other for
ratings.  They know that if they suddenly opt to air lectures about art history
at 8pm on Wednesdays, audiences not into that kind of programming will simply
flock to a competitor showing something more entertaining.  They also argue
that the public has expressed an interest for the so-called “bad” shows Minow
is pooping on, and that they serve the public interest by providing those
shows. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            They
also question whether educating the public is really their job.  Newspapers,
libraries, schools, and colleges exist for that reason. Is it really on private
entertainment corporations to educate the nation’s children?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>At the end of the day, the commercial imperative means that <i>profit </i>is
the number one goal of television broadcasters. To the extent that profit and
public interest are in conflict, broadcasters in a commercial system will
always choose profit! It is literally their job.  Educating kids is certainly a
worthy goal, but if you expect a corporation to do that instead of maximizing
their earnings, you’re nuts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>SS
Minow</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So,
some people agree with Minow. Other people say that he’s an elitist snob and he
should keep his grubby mitts of their shows and let them watch <i>Green Acres </i>in
peace. Commercial television corporations are kind of like…whatever, Newt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            …but
there’s also this kind of apocryphal story—I’ve never seen any proof it, but it
bounces around media studies classes and I’ve been taught the story, so <i>why
not </i>repeat it?  If you’re not familiar with the show <i>Gilligan’s Island, </i>it’s
a dopey show from the 1960s about a bunch of people who get stuck on a desert
island. The boat that crashes is called the S.S. Minnow, and there’s a rumor
that it was named after Newton Minow as kind of a dig. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, in some ways he fails to get the
networks to change their kinds of programming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Presidential
Medal of Freedom</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
he is remembered for a few things.  The vast wasteland speech does resonate
with a lot of people, and it inspires some folks to think in new ways about
what television might do to serve the American public—particularly American
children. We’ll revisit that next week. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            He
also clears the way for communications satellites, which lays a crucial
technological infrastructure for…almost everything we do today? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He also helped pass—and this is going to
sound a little finicky and inside baseball, but stick with me—the All Channel
Receiver Act in 1961. Remember when we talked about that old Zenith commercial,
<i>Fog Over Portland</i>, which was extremely melodramatic about their
televisions getting both UHF and VHF channels? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Well,
Minow’s legislation made it so all televisions sold in the US had to get both
kinds of channels.  And UHF stations are where a lot of <i>public</i> stations
begin to broadcast, and where our earliest educational programs lived. This
seemingly very technology-focused act in fact helps to get more kids more
educational programs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
Newt is actually still with us! He’s still kicking at 94.  He gave an interview
to <i>Ad Age </i>back in 2011, on the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his famous
speech, and they asked whether he thought television was still such a vast
wasteland. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Minow
says that the argument he was truly making was about <i>choice</i>. He never
wanted to censor bad shows, but he was concerned that in the 1960s, when most
people got just three or four channels, there were no other options. There
wasn’t an alternative for folks looking for more educational shows for
themselves or their kids. And he argues that it’s a very different environment
now, and that’s probably a pretty good thing.  People have hundreds of channels
at their disposal, both very educational and very not, but a larger smorgasbord
of programming is all he really ever wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            <b>[ANIMATION]
</b>He also makes this very prescient observation. He says that the flipside of
all that choice is that perhaps we’ve lost a “common shared experience” through
television.  When we gain endless choice in programming—particularly in news
programming—people can always find a presentation of current events that
cements their already existing world view.  And, nine years later, we see this
argument all the time—that filter bubbles, algorithms, cable news, and other
aspects of our endless media buffet contribute to the polarization of opinions.
He says there might have been something valuable to everyone watching Walter
Cronkite deliver the news of the day.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Obviously, that’s something that’s very
much up for debate. People fall on all sides of this argument—I sometimes think
different things about this depending on what’s going on in the world. But it’s
something that’s interesting to consider, and it’s particularly interesting
coming from a man who was deeply concerned with what television could do for
us, the viewers, and our democracy.</span></p>

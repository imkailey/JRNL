## meeting over genre paper

### my two characteristics
- character 
  - narcos focuses more on the villain 
  - more of a focus on the logistics of the business 
  - this has to do with character bc
- iconography 
  - part of mise en scene
  - mise-en-sc√©ne
  - generally urban area
  - narcos turns this on its head with 
  - the iconography upset by narcos

---

- we looking at things through the lens of the criminal
- narcos focuses on pablo escobar and how he got started in cocaine 
  - also the guy that got him into it
  - all narrated by a narcotics officer
- focused on the character of the gangster between self serving and community 
  - gangster as anti hero 
  - anti hero is supposed to be more a regular person we can see ourselves as

---

- gangster genre about business
- violence of profit
- capitalism

---

- agriculture is a big part of the early gangster genre
  - prohibition and making alcohol
- interesting play between agriculture and the city
  - focusing on distribution 
  - narcos focusing on production and distribution but from columbia 
  - in untouchables, its all distribution 
    - al capone
- what you focus on story wise will completely change the aesthetic and how everything plays out

---

- p 85 has stuff with the characters 
- take character iconography and compare and contrast between the two characters 
- pay attention to the first couple pages 
- find two other articles but schatz paper is what you wanna focus on 
- get thesis in by tomorrow to get thesis checked

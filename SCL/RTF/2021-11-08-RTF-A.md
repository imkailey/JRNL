### genre characteristics?
- I need to find the characteristics of the gangster genre
- maybe in my notes for one of the lectures
- maybe ask tomorrow in discussion

### initial thoughts
- the tv show we watched felt like the intro part of the untouchables
- felt liike setting up a bigger plot over time between the narc guy and pablo 
- both almost feel like documentary to some extent 
- they use real people i think for the villains
- idk how true to reality though, probably not very
- protagonists as villains in untouchables, narco kinda not necessarily as the people doing the drugs are seen as bad
- everyone wants alcohol, not everyone wants cocaine

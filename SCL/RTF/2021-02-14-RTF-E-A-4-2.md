Post both and image that represents your example and at least a 5 sentence description of how the example blurs the line between advertising and culture. 

This ad shows a more positive and iclusive version of masculinity. This ad tries to take something seen as a stereotypical father son bonding experience, and presents it with a trans man. It tries to push for the normalization and humanization of trans people by putting a trans man in a role normally seen by a cis man.

### Classical realism

  - establish various genre cues
- Animation
  - through the characters and their actions
- Intensification
  - everything intensifies over time until the climax
- Resolution
  - the tension is resolved
  - momentarily resolve unresolvable problems society dealing with

### Modernist qualities
- Process over product
  - not necessarily about the story but how you tell it
- Innovative technique
  - more formally experimental and idealogical
- Active viewer
  - requires a more active and engaged viewer to pay attention
- Open text
  - not all the loose ends are wrapped up
- Ambiguous resolutions
  - motives not as clear
  - not everything get wrapped up 

### postmodernism
- Reproduction
  - very very referential to other works
  - reusing and referring to elements of other works 
  - incorporating and recombining elements 
- Detachment
  - not necessarily trying to use genre and form for some kind of broader sociopolitical or cultural purpose
  - pure entertainment and capital
- Ahistorical
  - throwing things at the board
  - mixing matching different time periods 
- Parody
  - often can go into full parody
  - not taking itself seriously
  - parody for parody sake

<!-- - I’m going to make a film that touches on when you found out I was wearing a bra. I don’t hold your reaction against you and I’m really really proud of how you’ve gotten on me being trans, but initially you didn’t have the best response, which I don’t hold against you. Still, it affected me for a while and I wanna make a film on it. I love you and tried my best not to make you out to be a bad person as much as a concerned mom-->

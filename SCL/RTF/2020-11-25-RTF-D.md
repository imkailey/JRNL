My question for you is, is there any media that you have rewatched (or relistened to, or replayed)? Some questions to consider: do you (or did you) do so for class, for pleasure, for work? Are you doing it for an express purpose, or just to experience the media? What was that experience like? Do you learn new things about the piece of media when you rewatch, and if so, what things jump out? Do you watch things alone, or with friends and family? Do you watch it on the same platform, or have you bought it more than once?

Lately I've been going back to music I used to listen to that holds a lot of significance in my own life, and that triggers memories of times in the past that might not have been the best or all that great.

An example of an artist's music I revisit is Kendrick Lamar. His albums <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> and <i>DAMN.</i> still elicit some raw emotions depending which song it is or where I am. Typically going back has the most effect when I'm alone, and a lot of my family kind of hate my music taste and how much I relisten to stuff in the same order over and over.

Sometimes it's good to look back at how far you've come, and that's something I'm working on right now. I've been doing a lot of introspection around a piece for my performance feminism class, and I've been doing a lot of driving around the break, so I've done my fair share of painful retrospection over this last little while.

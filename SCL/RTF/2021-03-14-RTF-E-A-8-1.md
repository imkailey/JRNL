When it comes to action films, typically the protagonist is a muscly straight white guy. almost always the protagonist is not disabled as well, whether physically or mentally. typically, in my mind, these protagonists are very stereotypically masculine. They're typically very outgoing and presented as very strong, dependable people. when it comes to who definitely isn't really shown as an action movie star, this is where LGBT people and disabled people aren't really shown at all. Even when it comes to LGB people or people who are less neurodivergent, we don't really see much representation there. This has the impact that we don't necessarily see these people as having the ability to be strong, physically or socially or emotionally in these films.

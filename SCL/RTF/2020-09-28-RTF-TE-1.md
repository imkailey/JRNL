for my first person, im going to choose Eadweard Muybridge. Muybridge was the person who set up many cameras and used high speed photography to make very very early motion pictures. he would essentially use tripwires to trigger each camera, and the inginuity of this solution to taking multiple frames of photography is really interesting to me, and works around the limitations of his equipment fairly well. most of his films are very very short, but are fairly interesting in the way that they were created. the amount of thought and effort that wouldve gone into this solution i think is really cool.

for my second person, im going to choose William Dickson. Dickinson is the man that Thomas Edison put in charge of getting to the more modern sense of motion pictures, that being with a strip of film going through a camera at a pretty high speed. I dont believe we learned much about him through our lectures, but i think it's interesting that he was able to essentially invent the way we would create films for the next 100 years over the course of a decade. obviously cellulose film and the methods of developing it had already been invented, but this is still a fairly big step forward in terms of motion picture technology at the time.

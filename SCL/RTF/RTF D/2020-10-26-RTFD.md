<!--Option 1. Ahh, yes. Good ol’ Newton Minow’s “vast wasteland” speech. As  you saw in Kathy’s lecture, and in your assigned reading, it was Minow’s hope that his speech would make TV networks understand that “it is not  enough to cater to the nation’s whims; you must also serve the nation’s  needs.” <b>Based on the outcome of Newton Minow’s speech as mentioned in  lecture, or his speech itself, do you think we’re in need of a “vast  wasteland” speech for the TV in 2020? </b>-->

<!--Option 2. In watching this week’s lectures--and particularly Kathy’s  lecture about non-fictional TV in the 1960s--I personally was struck by  the number of parallels between the media's relationship with current  events (and vice versa). This isn’t so much of a question as much as it  is a reflection: <b>talk to me about if there’s anything that you saw in  the lecture about the ways in which non-fictional media was used as a  means to document, inform, or subvert current events that reminds you of recent years.</b>-->

**Option 2.**

<p>When it comes to the non fictional portrayal of things in the 60's, it looks like they tried to, especially in the elections of JFK, try to make things seem very casual in the interviews and things like that, along with using celebrity endorsements like Frank Sinatra to try to widen appeal further. They tried to make him relatable and charming for a general public, as opposed to how Nixon came off during his debate with Kennedy. This is very similar to how politics is done today, with things like Taylor Swift, Madonna, Cardi B, Tom Hanks and George Clooney all endorsing Joe Biden in the 2020 general Presidential Election. (I looked that up and got it off BBC I can cite if needed.) <br><br>
    Also, the assasinations and deaths of huge public figures covered through TV and other mediums, led to news coverage having a feeling of being more raw or real, along with all of the protests and violent police reactions to said protests that were also on TV. I'm not sure how many assasinations we've seen on TV in recent years, but the death of George Floyd and others being recorded and going viral on social media has led to a similar visceral feeling, if not even more visceral, just due to the fact that often these videos are done with phones from closer up, as opposed to being using TV cameras or other recording devices at the time. <br><br>
    The mentioned violence against peaceful protesters by the police is still rampant, and doesn't need to be allowed by the TV networks to go viral or get a big audience today. <br><br>
    It feels as though this is just an extension of what was going on in the 60s, we just have a better way of documenting these things today that is more driven by individuals and groups of normal citizens, as opposed to on TV.</p>

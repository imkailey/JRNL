Starting off with the network era, it was mostly signified by very few channels due to broadcast TV. This led to a more cohesive image of Unites States TV from this era across the population, as most people would be watching the same thing. Mostly ABC, NBC, and CBS controlled the airwaves during this time, and I believe *The Twilight Zone* aired as well.

Heading into the multi-channel era, this is when cable tv started to rise to prominence. This led to an explosion of different channels and content being made and narrowcasted to specific audiences. MTV rose to prominence during this time

Heading into the Post Network Era, now we have Netflix and Hulu and everyone else having their own streaming services and creating exclusive content for their service that wouldn’t have been made otherwise. This allows for even more narrowcasting to occur, and for recommendations to be tailored for each person. The reboot of *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* was created in the Post Network Era, and it is my favorite show, as it is the most gay.

The new Hollywood; why Hollywood relied on blockbusters in the 1970s

Two strategies used by jaws team to engineer a blockbuster

During the 70s, Hollywood came to rely on the blockbuster movie to stay afloat. During the way early days of block booking, studios would churn out films like factories. However, after the paramount decree they couldn’t own the exhibition and distribution of their films if they were the producers of the film. This was to cut down on monopolistic practices in the industry. Over time, studios would start to make fewer films, and try to make them good to sell to the theatres. As the TV started to become a phenomenon around the time suburbanization really started to take off, it wasn’t super feasible to have huge movie palaces in cities, so drive in theatres started to pop up everywhere. Over time, this describes a downward trend in the number of films each studio makes. Eventually, TV led to a conundrum where you would really have to sell a film really well with lots of lights, action, colors, and sounds to impress the audience. This led both film creation budgets and film advertisement budgets to skyrocket, causing each film to need to be a huge success for a good return on investment. 

One of the strategies the team behind jaws used very effectively was word of mouth marketing. They went to events and promoted the film in order to drive up demand and continue to build up hype for the film over time. As interest increased, they continued their advertising further. 

The second strategy ties into the first. They started off with a limited release for the film, causing it to be a slow burn. This led to interest continuing to rise up until it got a general release. They used the initial hype and profit of the film in order to have a wider release. They also tied all of the merchandise together really well so they had a unified and punchy brand image, and used that to sell a bunch of stuff and increase profits further.

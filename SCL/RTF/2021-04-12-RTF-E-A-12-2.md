### Question
In 4-5 sentences discuss what the preferred reading/dominant code might be for this [video](https://youtu.be/IdneKLhsWOQ) [wildest dreams music video](https://youtu.be/IdneKLhsWOQ) and contrast that with what an oppositional code might be?

### Answer
This song is about a summer fling with another actor in a film, according to the music video. At the end of the summer of the music video, the film theyre shooting wraps. She then realizes on the red carpet that he had a wife the whole time. She's kind of ok with this I think. My alternate reading is that maybe their relationship wasn't super healthy. It shows them pushing and shoving each other multiple times in the video. I think in context he's supposed to be a 'bad boy', which might be his appeal, but this stereotype can lead to abuse.

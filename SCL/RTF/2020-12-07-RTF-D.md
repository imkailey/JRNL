Option 1: This week's materials brings us to the contemporary age, and in particular the impact of digital technology on media history in the form of convergence, participatory culture, influencers and micro-celebrity. In this vein, please read, watch, or listen to a recent social media post (on your platform of choice, and drop a link for me, please), and apply something you've learned in this class. Some ideas to consider: do you see any "untold" stories being told? Are you seeing the construction of a celebrity brand? Can you pinpoint moments of convergence? Do you see any polysemy at play? Are they engaging in participatory culture? Maybe they're talking about the Hays Code (ok, this one's a joke, but if you find Charli D'Amelio making a TikTok about the Hays Code, PLEASE send it my way)!

Honestly, I don’t really pay attention to much social media, but I did realize that tiktok houses and streamer houses often turn the influencer into the consumer, and drain their income for little gain. Often, the people they hire as managers aren’t qualified at all, and theyre taking advantage of kids and teens who don’t know better. I think a lot of this has to do with the sudden explosion in the amount of people who have a following and also enough success to kind of live that celebrity lifestyle. A lot of it is pretty gross tbh.

// we will need to learn about both Chicano history to learn about Chicano film history
- Chicano Cinema is linked to 60s and 70s activism

### bracero program
- grew out of a series of bi-lateral agreement between Mexico and the United Stated, allowed millions Mexican men to come to United Stated to work on short-term, primarily agricultural labor contracts
- from 1942-64, 4.6 mil contracts signed
- acknowledged how they were understood to be needed, but were left out of Civil Rights
  - not accepted as Americans

#### deterritorialization
- the separation of social, cultural, and political practices from a location

**Cesar Chavez**
civil rights leader, labor activist, and co-founder of the National Farm Workers Association, which eventually became United Farm Workers, who represented and bargained for thousands of workers in California and Florida.

**Dolores Huerta**
- the other co-founder of the National Farm Workers Association, who is still alive and still a powerful activist for change.
> “Every moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.”
- Dolores Huerta

**Delano grape strike**
- They were fighting for
  - better wages and more rights for workers who picked grapes in California
  - they orchestrated five-year national boycott of non-union grapes

**Chicano Blowouts**
- also known as the East L.A. Walkouts
- series of protests in 1968 by Chicano high school students in Los Angeles.
- they were demanding
  - More equitable resources for their schools
  - a curriculum that addressed (not denigrated) their history.

**Frito Bandito**
- a stereotypical Frito-Lay campaign that they ran from 1967 to 1971
- In response to this and other bigoted and belittling stereotypes of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in media and advertising, two advocacy groups were formed.  
  1. IMAGE,
    - founded in San Antonio, Texas  
  2. National Mexican American Anti-Defamation Committee
    - based in Washington D.C.

### **Chicano Cinema rises from these movements and symbols**
> “mark out a space for itself between a weapon and a formula, between the political weapon of New Latin American cinema, and the economic formula of Hollywood.”  
- Dr. Noriega

- By “the political weapon of New Latin American cinema,” Dr. Noriega is referring to a wave of explicitly political films emerging from Cuba, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil in the 1970s
  - sometimes called “Third Cinema.”
  - Its goal was to tie filmmaking to the cause of revolution.  These films were meant to be non-commercial, they rejected filmmaking as means of individual expression, and they considered their true goal to speak for and about the masses in service of liberation.

#### Johansen’s manifesto
- rejects Hollywood film as the cinema of the ruling class, and instead argues that Chicano film should be made by and for the community.
**His manifesto also lays out six pillars that Chicano cinema should strive to accomplish:**
  1. It should demystify film for its audiences and bring the filmmaking process to the people
  2. It should decolonize minds and reaffirm Chicano culture
  3. It should be reflective and open-ended instead of telling viewers what to think
  4. Its goal should be altering consciousness—here, meaning political awareness
  5. It should effect social change; film should be a part of the “revolutionary process”
  6. It should develop its own film language

- Chicano Cinema by Chicano for liberation

#### Hollywood learns

- Hollywood didn’t learn to apply its formula to this market until 1987-1988
  - it released four Chicano-Latino feature films like Stand and Deliver
  - mini wave called "hispanic hollywood"

- Chicano Cinema interesting bc combines both these

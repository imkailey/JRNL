### 1. domestic consumption of movies


- as people moved out to suburbs; didnt travel to theatres much anymore


- even tho theatres less popular; film *even* ***more*** popular than ever

---

- satd night movie became a thing
  - grew the popularity of films on tv; many other stations made movie nights on tv; was a new way for people to watch the old movies they loved; there wasn't anything like that before in a large capacity

---

- thru 1960s; movies grew from just over 2 hours of primetime to over 16 hours; by 1972; movies accounted for 25% of all primetime tv




---

- there are issues with broadcasted movies in the early 1970s

- however, both HBO and VHS VCR hit the market at virtually the same time; allowed uncut, uninterrupted films at home

---

### 2-3 portable format and proliferation of VCR

- at the beginning; was marketed as a time shifting device; change tv schedule to your schedule
  - there was VHS and Betamax
  - VHS lower res but longer
  - Betamax higher res but shorter

- between 1980 and 1990; price plummeted for VHS

- porn was moved from a public thing [theatres] to almost exclusively a private thing [VHS in your own home]

- the mall became a big place for cultural goods; this allowed the proliferation of VHS rental places to occur

---

- originally tapes were ***so*** expensive; not allowed to rent; cost a lot to buy

- ecen then; rental stores became a thing almost immediately

- video stores fought on the grounds of first sale doctrine; first sale doctrine: the copyright holder has the right to the art, but not the actual physical version of the art after it is already sold; cant tell rental places what they can and cant do with what they own

- video stores were originally more like nickelodeons; mom and pop operations that opened up everywhere; led to a decentralization of power

- grassroots nature means way more say in whats going on than most things


---

#### p o r n

- everywhere was in the main store; maybe a place in the back with like a curtain; well lit and other stuff

- allowed films to be proliferated way way way moree


---

After watching Kimberlee Crenshaw's TedTalk on Intersectionality, answer the following questions in 6-10 sentences (total).  You may go over 10 sentences if you need to. 

 1) define intersectionality in your own words and referencing Crenshaw's TedTalk

intersectionality is the crossing of multiple identities in one individual to create specific oppressions that happen specifically due to the way those identities interact in society. this is generally more the intersection of treatment of those identities, than things intrinsic to them. for example, being trans and disabled can get you treated very differently if you were just one or the other. whether that's stereotypes of trans people being mentally ill or the medical gatekeeping of not just trans healthcare, but also mental healthcare in general. Another example is, being mentally disabled, I have a hard time contacting people and getting paperwork done, along with a harder time figuring out who to even reach out for things to begin with. this can affect me being able to get a legal name change or change my IDs gender marker, or even just getting an updated picture on my ID. Police quiz me on my ID to make sure it's me, and often misgender me as well. This is despite passing very well, and makes things very confusing. 

2) state why studying intersectionality in media is important

in the media, we need to understand and study intersectyionality to know how people are presented, how they are treated, and how people's individual identities interact with one another. 

3) analyze a scene media text (a TV show, a film, etc) using intersectionality. You should offer a brief description of the scene and then discuss how you see intersectionality at play.

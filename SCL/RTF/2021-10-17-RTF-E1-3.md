1. How does LOST demonstrate the concept of Cult TV (you may use the pilot episode or the season 2 clip screened in class)? 

- draws from quality and complex programming
- sci-fi fantasy, horror; textually innovative; discerning audiences; emerging narrative over time; anti-mainstream

LOST demonstrates Cult TV because of the way it cultivates an audience reaction, and because of the way it builds a world. LOST is very serialized, with many characters and lots of suspense. For example, when Jack is tells the pilot that there was 45 survivors of the crash, and at the end of the episode it ends on a cliffhanger of the dead pilot in the tree. Even with the one episode and the clip we saw it was obvious that they were building a detailed narratvie world, with lots of mysteries for the viewers to try to solve, like the pattern on the back of the blast door. 

2. How does What We Do in the Shadows demonstrate the concept of comedy verit√©? Be sure to use specific examples in your response.

First of all, What We Do in the Shadows is filmed in a fake documentary style, with cutaways to interviews with the characters. Also, there was the narration from the main vampire character. It is also filmed in a single camera style, and wasn't filmed in the order, along with multiple takes of each scene being done. In What We Do in the Shadows, there's also visual effects used when the vampires fly away.

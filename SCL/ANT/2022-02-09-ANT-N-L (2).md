## intro to evolution
### intro
- go to office hours
- some narrrated slides that we need to go thru
- meet during office horus this week about ssd accommodations

###
- evolution is the single most important concept in modern biology

### whats science
- scienctific knowledge is:
1. empirical
  - based on observatinos of the world around us (foten quantitative)
2. testable
  - often thru experimentation
  - *potentially* falsifiable
  - repeatable
- famous for list questions on exams, take note of this
- science can't answer certain questions

### 3 part hierarchy of scientific certainty:
- hypothesis - untested but consistent with prior known facts
- theory - hypothesis supported by substantial empirical data - answers why
- lawstatement that predicts results of certain intitial conditions, so well supported as to be considered fact
  - WHAT HAPPENS
- scientific theory - well established explanation of some part of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferencecs, and tested hytheses
- science thry includes miltuiple parts
- no amount of validation changes a multi part theory into a law
### thing
- gravity is also a scientific theory
### evolution is
- scientific theory that
- invorporates multiple faces
- predictions of the unifying theory have been repeatedly confirmed
- universally accepted within the scientific community
### evolution is
- change in allele frequencies in a population over time
- gene - small section of dna that codes for a protein
- alleles - varieants of the same gene
### imp notes
- 1. population is the unit of evolutionary change
  - individuals dont evolve
- 2. genetic material must change for evolution to occur
### evolution = change in allele frequencies in a population over time
- will be on every lecture exam for every class with this professor
### 2 levels of evolution study
- 1. microevolution
  - shorter time change
  - change within a species
- 2. macroevolution
  - millions of years
  - longer time frame
  - origin and extinction of species

there's an online part and I'm allowed to take a break

### natural selection[list question]
- 1. variation
- 2. heredity
- 3. differential reproductive
- when hese 3 condition occur, evolutionary change is inevitable
### definitions
- reproductive success: # of offspring one produces that reaches reproductive age
- fitness: an individual's RS relative to the RS of other members of the same species
- adaptation: a trait that is favored by natural selection

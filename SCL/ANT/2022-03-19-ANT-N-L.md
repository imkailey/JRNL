A Very Brief History of Evolutionary Thought
- Q:  What did an educated European know about the natural world in 1492?
European thought during the Middle Ages:

1. Earth at center of universe 
  - (Ptolemy ~ 140 A.D.)
  - Wrote down everything known about heavens, codified Earth as center

2. Earth very young

### James Ussher (1581-1656)
- Earth created on Sunday Oct. 23, 4004 BC

### European thought during the Middle Ages based on:
- Plato: "World of Ideals"

(If species based on a fixed "ideal type", how could they change through time?) 

Aristotle -  

- How to classify living things?
- "Scala Naturae"
  - Ladder of Nature
  - Great Chain of Being
- Scala Naturae: Organisms can be grouped on a linear scale from simple to complex
  - (Of course, humans on top)

### Explanations of diversity relied on 1 particular form of explanation:

- Teleology - the use of ultimate purpose or design as a means of explaining natural phenomena (think divine purpose)
Explanations of diversity relied on 1 particular form of explanation:

### Like science, teleologyis 1 way of knowing. But, teleology =/ science.

### Summary of European thought in Middle Ages:
1. World young & at center of universe
2. Fixity of species (no evolution - everything based on a Platonic “ideal” type)
3. Humans at top of scala naturae
4. Organisms successful at what they do, because that's how they were designed

### 2 guys responsible for 1st radical departure from this worldview:
- Copernicus - 1473-1543
  - Sun (not Earth) = center of universe
  - Q: What’s the big shift in thinking here?
  - A: Don’t just trust the word of some Greek who’s been dead for 1400 years, go out & look for yourself!
    - Hypothesis testing using empirical data
- Galileo - 1564-1642
  - Showed Copernicus, not Ptolemy, was right.
- So - the earth isn't at the center of the universe, but humans are still at the top of the scala naturae, right?
- Carolus Linnaeus(1707-1778)
  - Founded modern taxonomy with Systema Naturae (1758)
  - Binomial classification
    - Believed in teleological explanations of natural phenomena & fixity of species
  - Used common attributes to group organisms
  - Grouped HUMANS with other primates in animal kingdom
  - Profound shift in thinking about place of humans in nature
  - Ironic twist: Not evolutionist.
  - System to describe God’s world
- Richard Owen(1804-1892)
  - Rabid Anti-Evolutionist
  - Homology 
  - Defined in 1843 as "the same organ in different animals under every variety of form & function"
  - Owen's explanation: there’s a divinely-ordained archetype for living organisms (common anatomical plans for different groups)
  - But - pointed out basic similarities in anatomy in otherwise very different organisms  laid groundwork for concept of common ancestry
- OK, so humans are just one branch of the tree of life, 
and they share fundamental anatomical similarities with hierarchically nested sets of organisms, but species are still fixed reflections of a Platonic ideal, right?
- Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon  (1707-1788)
  - Historie Naturelle (1749-1804)
  - 1 of 1st prominent scientists to suggest:
    1. the earth > 6000 y.o. 
    2. species change over time
    3. noted anatomical similarity between humans & apes & discussed possibility of common ancestry (no mechanism though)

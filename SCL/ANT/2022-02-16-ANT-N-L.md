- exaptation: sometimes adaptations evolve for one function, get used in another context
- feathers were Originally adaptation for keeping warm, then exaptation for flight

- Taxonomy - scientific classification [based shared characteristics]
- Phylogeny - a model of presumed evolutionary relationships based on shared characteristics

- 2 basic types of characters:
  - Primitive - features shared by a group that are inherited from a more distant common ancestor = plesimorphy
  - Derived - evolutionary innovations that evolved *de novo* in the group in question - apomorphy 

- mammal LCA [last common ancestor] 
  - hair
  - hair is plesiomorphic for primates 
- mammal LCA
  - claws
  - Primate LCA 
  - nails are apomorphic for primates

- rule 1 of finding a cladogram 
  - cant use shared primitive characteristics [symplesiomorphies] to reconstruct evolutionary relationships only shared derived characteristics [synapomorphies]

- second problem 
  - sometimes you run into homoplasy 
  - Independent evolution of similar features in 2 or more lineages [usually in response to similar pressures in environment ]

- rule 2 
  - homoplasy is everywhere, makes reconstructing phylogenies very difficult

IMPORTANT
- 3types homoplasy 
  1. Convergence - evolution of similar structures using different anatomical features as a starting point
    - eg: convergent evolution of gliding structures in animals
    - Similar features resulting from convergent are said to be analogous
  2. Parallelism - evolution of similar structures using the same anatomical feature as a starting point
    - eg: parallel evolution of prehensile tails in South America [tails are primitive for mammals]
    - remember: structures derived from the same feature are called homologous
  3. Evolutionary reversal - re-evolution of a plesiomorphic feature
    - eg: re-evolution of claws in some primate clades  [aye-ayes and …]
    - Claws apomorphic for aye-ayes but *look* plesiomorphic

### principle of parsimony
- assume that features will evolve as few times as possible
- Minimizes homoplasy
- Parsimony = ‘stinginess’

---

- When reconstruct phylogenies
1. Use only synapomorphies
2. Employ principle of parsimony
- called cladistic methodology
  

- for living species, genetic synapomorphies 
- Retrotransposons - sequences of dna that can copy themselves [at random] and reinsert themselves [at random] in the genome
- READ THRU THE READING FOR GENETICS
- Alu elements are retrotransposons found in primates and close relatives
- More than 65 MYA a copy was transcribed into dna and inserted into the genome of ancestors 
- because of this, really easy to tell where the homoplasy is and isn’t in primates and close ancestors 

- issue with fossils is that you cant get genetics from them
- People are getting way better at getting dna from these samples, but need to be pretty recent

### homo species diversity
- some people lump most fossils from the same area and time into one species
- others split it up into differetn species
- most people think 1470 and 1813 are two different species today, Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis
- sexual dimorphism normally happens with intrasexual selectioncranial evolution
- from archaic to globular brain casing shape
- face made more vertical
- teeth smaller
- variation in supra orbital morphology
- less opost orbital constriction
- location of greatest medio lateral cranial breadth varies
  - moves up over time
- Homo erectus has
  - sagittal keel
    - small bump at sagittal and not for chewing
  - occipitol torus
    - bump back bottom of brain
- neanderthals have an occipital bun
  - more proounced bump
- review Homo florensiensus

### trends in Homo dental evolution
- cheek tooth size decreases
- mandible more gracile
- reduction size of dentition leads to
  - reduction in facieal prognathsis
  - more orthognatic face
- evolution mental eminence
  - eg chin

### rules need to know
  - berghmanns rule
  - trunk of the body
  - general principal for animals
- allens rule
  - long limbs promote heat dissipation
  - short limbns promoteheat retention

### homo post cranial adaptations
- adaptations warm climate
  - long slender body
  - long limnbs
- adaptations for cold cliumate
  - short stocky bodies
  - short limbs
- Homo habilis kept same Australopithecus proportionjs
- Homo ergaster exhibits first evidence of hind limbs lengthening
- Homo ergaster, Homo neaderthalensis, and Homo sapiens show evidence of climate adaptaitons
- H erectus
  - warm climate
  - long limbs
- Homo neanderthalensis
  - colder climate
  - stocky trunk
  - short limb bones
- Homo sapiens
  - depends on climate

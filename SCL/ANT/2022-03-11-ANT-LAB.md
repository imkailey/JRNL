### definitions
- species concepts
  - 2 definitions
  - fossils?
- developing precise criteria that allows for sufficient flexibility is difficult
- debates arise over operational definitions even when no debate about the existence of the phenomenon
- application of species concepts:
  - conservation policy
  - identifying new fossil species
### objectives
- examine concept of sex
- ansiogamy: form of sexual reproduction involving union of 2 gametes, differing in size/form
- gamete: a haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during conception, gametes are sex cells
- gonad: reproductive gland that produces gametes
- genitals: external sex organs, visible parts of the body that do reproduction
- sex chromosomes: chromosomes involved with determining sex of an individual
- first 22 pairs are called autosomes
- chromosomes of 23rd pair are called allosomes
- hormone: chemical messenger, how one part of your body to communicates with another part of your body
- sex steroids: a type of hormones that are produced by gonads
  - are androgens and estrogens
- secondary sexual characteristics: sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that are not directly related to the reproductive system and that appear as an individual reaches sexual maturity
- intersex: a category that describes a person whose reproductive, genetic, genital, or hormonal configuration doesn't seem to fit the traditional definitions of male or female

### application of definition in biological anthropology
- most biological anthropologists don't know the gametes of their subjects

### covariation of traits
- if 2 traits covary, then they vary together and if you know one trait, you can predict the other trait
- if sex-traits covary, then it doesn't matter which trait is used to define sex

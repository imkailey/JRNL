- Hierarchy is for minimizing hurt when it comes to conflict
- 4 forces evolution needed to know
  - natural selection is one
- today is genetics
- Lab practical exam march 4
  - talk about next week

---

- Observation 
  - the given thing happening in reality that you will base your hypothesis on

- Hypothesis
  - make sure the hypothesis has to do with the observation

- Null hypothesis
  - State that the proposed effect is not observed
  - Specifies what isn’t being observed
  - Shouldn’t be vague

Tarsiers split off before anthropoids in the graph, just couldn’t fit it, they are haplorhines though

## basic genetics and forces of evolution

### prior to Darwin and Wallace
- organisms recognized as species
- organisms organized based on phenotypic similarity
- but
  - fixity of species

### Darwin and Wallace
- mid to late 1800s
  - individually came to similar conclusions explaining the observable variation in the natural world
- origin of species 1859

### resources limited
- more individuals born than can ever survive
- struggle for existence

### variation
- organisms vary in their ability to survive
- organisms vary in their ability to reproduce
- some individuals compete better in certain environments, tend to leave more offspring

### inheritance
- those traits that enable some individuals to survive and reproduce are passed on to their offspring
- differential reproduction
  - some individuals leave more offspring than others

### three postulates of n.s
- natural selection based on these
  - limited resources
  - variation
  - inheritance
- didn’t understand how that inheritance happened
- how traits passed on

### basic principles of inheritance
- Gregor Mendel first discovered the basic rules of inheritance in the 1850s by carefully breeding pea plants

### before Mendel
- blended inheritance
- Mendel showed particulate inheritance
- still didn’t know genes or dna

### simple mendelian genetics
- Mendelian trait
  - a trait determined by a single gene
- phenotype
  - observable characteristics of an individual 
  - influenced by
    - Genotype genetic makeup
    - Environment
- allele alt form of a gene
  - pea color may be yellow or green
  - primates have 2 alleles for every gene
- dominant an allele that can mask the effect of another allele
- recessive an allele whose effect can be masked by the effect of another allele
- homozygous having 2 copies of the same allele
- heterozygous having 2 different alleles

### common misconceptions
- simple Mendelian inheritance applies to a few cases in nature
- 1 gene = 1 trait
  - most traits are polygenic
  - not every trait we observe has a genetic basis
- gene regulation…

### since Mendel
- understand chemical nature of inheritance
- structure and function of DNA

### dna is packaged in chromosomes
- chromosomes highly compacted and bundled strands of DNA

## bio molecules### basic dna structure
- dna deoxyribonucleic acid
  - Watson and crick 1953
    - but really Rosalind franklin
  - double stranded helix
  - holds all the information necessary for life
- base pairing
  - dna is made up of 4 basic nucleotides
  - nucleotides pair with each other in specific ways

### rna
- rna ribonucleic acid
- structurally similar to dna, with some differences
  - thymine is replaced by uracil
  - shorter overall length
  - single stranded
  - used to make copies of genes

### central dogma of biology
- genotype 
- phenotype
- dna 
- rna 
- protein
- gene sequence of nuclei acids that carry information for making proteins
- allele alt form of a gene
- MAY NEED FOR A TEST
- transcription mRNA copy of a gene is made by base pairing
- translation mRNA messages translated into proteins

## four forces
- mutation
- genetic drift
- gene flow
- natural selection

### mutation
- ultimate source of all variation
- changes in the DNA sequences of individuals compromising a population
- can occur thru
  - substitution
  - insertions
  - inversions
  - duplications
- most mutations either neutral or deleterious- occasionally mutations can be advantageous

### genetic drift
- sum effect of random changes in allele frequencies within a population
- Mendel law of independent assortment
- particularly evident in small populations
  - founder effect
  - population bottlenecks

### gene flow
- transfer of alleles between populations
- must consist of two events
  - 1. Migration
  - 2. Mating

### natural selection
- non random survival and reproduction of individuals in a variable population due to heritable phenotypes
- survival of the fittest and the consequent change in alleles present is natural selection

### consequences
- competitively advantageous alleles will spread thru the population over time

## culture - can it occur in non humans
### difinitions 
- old definition of culture 
  - pattern of behaviors thats socially transmitted, rather than fenetically inherited or stimulated by particular environmental conditions 
- new definition IMPORTANT
  - behavior pattern shared by members of a commjnity that relies on socially learned or transmitted information
- first came around to the idea of culturein non-humans with imo wasjhing her potatoes, spread to others in the population
  - since, have found that many primates have culture 
<!-- had to leave for a call-->

### gene-culture coevolution 
- 2 inheritancec systems transmitting info and generating phenotypic change
- genes and culture
- cultural activity can select for traits that further enhance cultural competencies, allow genes and culture evolve reciprocally 
- occurs when cultural evolution shapes genetic evolution often entailing innteractions between the two 
- animal culture 
  - found in insects, birds, fish, mammals 
  - impact fitness
  - stable over generations can effect evolution 
- lontailed macaques use rocks to crack shellfish, culturally transmitted 

### cultural changes selection on functional genes 
- orca clans that eat different things often have slightly differenct digestive systems

## primate evolution 
- 220-66 mya dinosaurs "ruled the earth"
- chixulub impact crater 
  - 66 mya 
- IMPORTANT 
- this impact marks cretaceous - palogene (K-Pg) mass extinction 
- most recent of at least 5 mass extinctions 
- competitive release for mammals 
- after extinction, mammal adaptive radiation
- colugos most related order dermoptera 
  - primatomorpla 
  - euachonta above that 
    - tree shews included
  - both are 
<!--another call-->
- species could move between north america, southeast asia, and africa easily when primates evolved 

### global temperature over cenozoic 
- reconstructed with oxygen isotopes
- oxygen isotopes measured in CaCO3 shells of tiny marine plankton 
- predictable relationship between water temperature and amount of heavy oxygen incorporated into CaCO3 shells 
- eocene warmest epoch of the ceozine
- boundary between paleocene and eocene warmest interval in last 66 mya 
- PETM paleocene eocene thermal maximum
  - marked by carbon isotope excursion 
    - indicates massive release C12 into biosphere
- primates exist SE Asia before PETM 
- moved up towards US and Europe and Asia

## Australopithecines

### goals
- austra
  - post cranial adaptations
  - cranial adaptations
- goals
  - be comfortyable using calipers
  - identify bipedalism adaptations
  - identify austalopithecine cranial features

### hominin evolutuion
- earliest hominins
  - sahelanthropus, orrorin <!--check-->
- early hominins
  - ardipithecus
  - austalopuithecus
  - paranthropus
- focusing on early hominins today
- many specis hominins coexisted over the last 7 mya

### hominin synapomorphies
- bipedalism
  - fossils will have evidence of adaptations reflecting bipedal locomotion

### adaptations for bipedalism
- lumbar spine
- pelvis
- hips
- knee
- foot

#### lumbar
- adaptations serve to reposition trunk over the base of support
- body center of mass must be over tyhe base of support
- bipedalism: small base of support
- luymbar lordosis
  - positions body center of mass over base of support
- s shape back instead of c shape back
- dorsal wedging
  - creates lordotic curve
  - makes lumbar vertebrae wedges
- more coronally oriented zygapophusal<!--check spelling--> joints
  - prevents the anterieor/ventral slipping
- large lumbar vertebrae
  - each one gets bigger
  - each oone supports heavier loads

#### pelvis
- medio-laterally directed iliac blades
  - stablize the hip
- stablize the leg not on the ground
  - austrolopithecine has this

#### femour
- valgus knee result of
- high bicondular angle
  - distal femur
  - knees close together above ankles and feet
  - developmentally plastic and changes from 1-5 y/o

#### foot
- hominins lose ability to grasp with the feet
- adducted hallux demostratesn a loss of pedal grasping abilirty
- robus hallus reflects propulsive toe-off mechanism

### australopithecines
- all austa fossils exhinit adaptations to bipedalism
- cranial adaptations
  - dentally theyre different from other african apes  1canine reduction and loss of honing complex
  - 1thicker enamel
  - 1inc cheek tooth area

#### comparing austa
- austalopuithecus
  - "gracile" australopithecine
- paranthropus
  - "robust" austalopithecine
    - cranial dental adaptations
- austalopithecus
  - reduced canines
  - megadontia = elarged molars
  - parabolic shaped dental arcade
  - laterally projecting zygomatic arches
    - lengthen force arm for masseter muscle
    - greater chewing muscle
  - relatively small brain size and large temporalis muscle creates post orbital constriction
- paranthropus
  - adaptations for heavy chewing
  - reduced canines
  - extreme megadontia
  - molariform premolars
    - premolars that look like molars
  - parabolic dental arcade
  - sagittal crest
    - increased area attachment temporalis muscle
    - develops with lots of chewing forces
  - exteme zygomatic flare
    - large site attachement for muscles

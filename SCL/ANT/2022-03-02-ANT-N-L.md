## Group-living - Primate Socioecology

### review 

#### primate ecology 
- primate ecology: study of how primates interact with their environment [including other organisms]
  - IMPORTANT

#### competitive exclusion principle
- no 2 organisms can have identiacal ecological niches
- requirements may overlap substantially
- one species will eventually out-compete the other 
- IMPORTANT

#### ecological release 
- ecological release/competitive release: a niche expansion folowing the removal of a constraining variable
  - IMPORTANT

### community ecology 
- community ecology: study of interactions among species in communities on many spacial and temporal scales
  - IMPORTANT 
- communities: assemblages of interacting populations of the species living withink a particular habitat

#### community ecology: microbes 
- disease ecology: study of the interaction of the behavior and ecology of hostst with the biology of pathogens
- factors influenting the transmission of infectious diseases 
  - environment 
  - host 
  - parasite
  - IMPORTANT

## group living 
### 2 main theoretical frameowrks for understanding primate behavior 
- sociobiology: examines bahgior in an evolutionary context - social evolution 
  - maitng
  - parental investment
  - kinship
- socioecology: examines how ecology influences behavior 
  - grouping patterns
  - distribution of resources
  - intergroup encounters
- IMPORTANT
### 2 strategies to reduce risk of predation 
1. crypsis 
  - camoflage, often associated with primates who are nocturnal, solitary, or live in small groups
2. group living
  - if you get attacked, there are a lot of other people around you to protect you 
- IMPORTANT
### 3 reasons group livign reduces predation risk 
1. detection: more eyes and ears 
2. deterrence: can mob the predator
3. dilution: lower the probability that you will be the one eaten
- IMPORTANT

### group size
- group living reduces risk of predation 
- as groups get bigger, food becomes more scarce
- group size determined by these two factors
- key concept in socioecology: variation in group size explained by varioation in **resource competition** and **predation risk**

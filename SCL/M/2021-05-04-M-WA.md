Many things that we  commonly interact with can be thought of as graphs. For example, in Section 6.1 we saw how a map of the city of Konigsberg can be represented by a graph, where the landmasses are vertices and the bridges connecting them are edges.

Think of your own real-life example of a graph. This can be something academic or something relevant to your day-to-day life. Write 1 paragraph describing your example. You may want to consider the following questions.

1. What are the edges and vertices in your graph?

2. What does your graph look like? Is it connected? Is it planar? Does it have lots of edges? Lots of vertices?

3. Are any of the results or theorems from the chapter applicable to your example?

I walk to places a lot, considering I live on campus. All of the places I go to regularly could be thought  of as vertices, with the roads connecting them as edges. While this isn't a perfect example, you could add some extra vertices for intersections or somthing to better apply to a map of this area. You could find Euler circuits, if my goal was to have a loop for a walk instead of an out and back. This is something I frequently did back when I used to hike with my dad. It's a lot more boring if you do an out and back, so it would be useful in that context.

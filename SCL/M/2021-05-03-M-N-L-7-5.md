## Dynamics
### what is dynamics 
- Dynamics is a branch of mathematics which studies changes in a system over time
- one goal
  - understand what causes changes in a system to predict future changes
- some applications
  - population growth 
  - the motion of the planets 
  - the weather 

### dynamic models of incremental prediction
- what we will be focusing on 
- this process incolves using our understanding of what causes changes in a system to predict the future changes 
  - then we repeat the process over and over into the future 

#### step by step 
1. Start somewhere
1. Apply a process to get a result
1. Apply the same process to that result to get a new result
1. Apply the same process to the new result to get a newer result
1. Keep repeating to predict the future!

### what is dynamics video
- this is a repeat of everything before it 

### compound interest ex
- the compound interest calculation that we see in the second video is an example of an exponential growth model
- At each stage the amount in the savings account grows at the same rate, so the amount will keep getting larger and larger without bound

### The Verhulst Population Model

In the Verhulst model:
- If the population is small relative to the maximum sustainable population, the fish will have lots of room and available resources, so there will be a large increase in population.
- If it is closer to the maximum sustainable population, there will be a smaller increase in population.
- If the population exceeds the maximum sustainable population, the population will decrease.

### Game of life 
- The Game of Life was invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970
- He was motivated questions in mathematical logic and simulation games
- John Conway made contributions to many areas of mathematics including 
  - number theory
  - game theory
  - combinatorics
  - knot theory
  - topology
  - algebra
  - analysis
- He passed away on 11 April 2020 from the coronavirus

##L3.1: beyond numbers; 3.2:comparing infinite 
### one to one correspondence
- you watch all the objects in one set to another set; can compare the sizes of each
  - can be done with numbers; can be used on infinite sets

### set notation

- commas between the variables
- elipses if continues between two points or forever
- Ex. all natural numbers from 1-50
  - {1,2,3,...,50}

One of the things that makes exploring the Möbius band fun is that so many properties of the Möbius band defy our expectations. We expect that it will have two edges and two sides because that's what it looks like it will have, but by carefully exploring and deeply understanding the Möbius band, we find out the surprising truth that there is only one side and one edge.

Think of a time when you were surprised to find out the truth about something.  This can be something deep, something academic, something silly. It's up to you. Write 1-2 paragraphs addressing the following questions.

    What did you believe before?
    What did you find out that was different and how?
    What assumptions did you make that led you to believe the wrong thing was true? 

I used to believe that racial equality wasn't a huge issue in the United States. I found out this was different around the time I started going to UT, maybe a bit earlier. I started to look into issues of racial equality around the time BLM became big again. I grew up extremely sheltered and went to elementary school at a private catholic school, and then highschool in the middle of nowhere. It wasn't an issue many people brought up or was apparent to me from my own experience, but a broadening of my perspective helped me to reach a better position on the matter.

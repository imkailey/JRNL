### Writing Assignment 2
<P>
<!-- What topics did you learn about?-->
<!-- -->
This last week I learned about the pigeonhole principle, and I also learned about complex and prime numbers. 
<!-- -->
<!-- How is this related to something you learned previously (in math or another field)? -->
<!-- -->
In the past I've covered similar things to the pigeonhole principle, and I've covered complex and prime numbers. 
<!-- -->
<!-- How confident do you feel in your understanding of this topic?-->
<!-- -->
I feel pretty confident in my understanding of these topics, 
<!-- -->
<!-- What about this topic is still unclear?-->
<!-- -->
and I don't think I have any huge gaps in my knowledge. 
<!-- -->
<!-- What do you wonder about now?-->
<!-- -->
Unless I draw out or visualise the problems we've covered so far, I have issues understanding the questions and hypotheticals. 
<!-- -->
<!-- What were your goals for the week? What have you done to help you meet those goals?-->
<!-- -->
I was hoping to keep up with the class and try not to fall behind on anything, and I think I've done a pretty good job of that so far. 
<!-- -->
<!-- What are your goals for the future? Are you going to do anything differently to meet those goals?-->
<!-- -->
Going forward I hope to grasp the problems in this class better and get decent grades, other than that I don't know what other goals to have. 
<!-- -->

Write 1 paragraph about your study strategies for the upcoming exam.

What are you going to do or have you already done to study for the second exam?

What worked or didn't work for the first exam? Is there anything you will do differently?


I'm going to show up to the study day tomorrow. Also, I'm going to go through my notes and rewrite them into a more readable and useful format for this exam. I'm going to go back through the lessons and make sure I didn't miss anything as well. I also might go back through some of the old homework and do some of the problems that weren't required to make sure I know how to do everything for the exam.

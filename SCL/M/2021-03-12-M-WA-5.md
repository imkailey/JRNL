M WA 5

When it comes to our last exam, I'm not super disappointed, but there's a lot of room for improvement. I didn't do all that much preparation heading into the exam, I should definitely review more next time. A lot of the things we're covering are things I covered in freshman or sophomore year of highschool. I take a lot of these things for granted, and it can mess me up sometimes. 

My goal for this week was to get more involved in class again; I had an absolutely awful week last week for many compounding reasons and wasn't able to make it to class. This week I've made it to class once and listened to the class I missed this week. I also went through and took notes on the things that I missed, and caught up overall. I helped the people in my group during today's class understand what was going on and how to think about the problems we got given.

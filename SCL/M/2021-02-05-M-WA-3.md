### Write 1 paragraph about your study strategies for the upcoming exam.

### What are you going to do or have you already done to prepare for the first exam?

I'm going to be typing up my notes and making sure I know what's going to be on the exam. I also might go through some of the homework and do some of the problems that weren't required to make sure I understand what's going on. I don't think I'll need any help, but if I run into anything I don't understand, I'll reach out to a TA or the instructor to understand the concepts before the exam.

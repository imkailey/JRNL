### el subjunctivo con antecedentes inexistentes o indefinidos [subjunctive for antecedents that don't exist or are indefinite]
- this section deals with a specific type of subordinate clause: the realative clause
- function of the relative clause is to describe a person or thing [the "antecedent"] mentioned previously in the main clause
- for example
  1. I have a **profession** [that offers me opportunity]
  2. We want to support **research** [that cures illnesses]
  3. My father wants to live in a **country** [where stem cell research is legal]
- uses this structure
  - verb + noun [antecedent] + que [or similar word] + verb phrase describing the antecedent

#### antecedents that don't exist and are indefinite
- when the antecedent doesn't exist or is indefinite or non specific, the subjunctive is used in the subordinate clause
  - like in #2 and #3 above
- isn't that off from all the other subjunctive rules
- already use subjunctive for doubt and denial
- with indefinite or non existent referents, the speaker is just doubting its existence

#### antecedents that exist and are definite
- on the other hand, when the antecedent does exist or is definite / specific, the indicative mood is used in the subordinate clause

#### La "a" personal
- as you know, we typically insert the personal "a" when the direct object of a verb is a personal
- however, the personal "a" is not used with indefinite/nonexistent antecedents

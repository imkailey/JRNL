## review for exam 2

### dudar y negar 
- I think you just conjugate normally for those when it comes to the conjugation exercises
- subjunctive is for when you arent sure, use indicative when you are sure
- yo creo que is indicative
- only subjunctive when you doubt
- dudar y negar it has to be subjunctive

### test info
- there will be a writing segment of the exam
- theres review materials on the canvas

### ending stuff
- dont need to turn in talk abroad separately
- need to do a post assignment

### questions

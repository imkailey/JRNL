I think it's crazy how we make certain forms of immigration illegal without any sort of big deal that I have noticed, even though these heavily affect people's lives and I'm generally really pro immigration.

<!--things to talk about-->

1. The talks about taking away birthright citizenship worry me a lot. There aren't that many ways of getting citizenship in the u.s, so the idea that could be taken away from people who have spent their whole lives living here in the u.s is scary.

2. The mention of trying to get people's spouseâ€™s green cards revoked is really upsetting to me as well, as a lot of the conservatives who are anti immigration really aren't fans of single-parent households and this would really exacerbate this issue.

3. The idea of going back through people's naturalization paperwork and revoking people who have already been naturalized as a citizen is also terrifying to me, as they went through and did everything and got citizenship only for people to come back and revoke it for small mistakes they didn't catch before.

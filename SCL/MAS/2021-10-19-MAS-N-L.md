### Afro-Latinos
- who is Afro-Latino
  - Latinos in the United States who are of African ancestry and choose Blackness as a racial identity
  - choosing race and ethnicity - what are the differences
- why is Blackness among Latinos denied or invisible
- when we use Latino as a race we lose a lot of the diversity among Latino people
- in Mexico they have avoided talking about Black people that are there bc they got rid of slavery fast, but there's still a lot of Black people there

### Afro-Latinos on the United States census
- 50% Latinos identify as White in 2010
  - 20% in 2020

### Mestizaje
- Mestizaje
  - Latin American population is racially mixed [indigenous, African, european]
  - creates racial harmony
  - suggests racism and racial inequality are not issues in Latin America
  - United States as the antithesis of Mestizaje - is this accurate?
- in Latin America there wasn't as bad as racial segregation in the past, but weren't as explicit
  - used language of racial harmony to stop conversations about racial injustice
  - *was* better than the worst places, but still covered up bad stuff
  - racial harmony language was to make Latin America look better than the United States
  - the phrenology of the United States would've hurt everyone in Latin America
  - racial mixing best for the society Latin America view

- Whitening in Latin America
  - government programs to Whiten the countries – Argentina, Cuba, Brazil, etc
  - resources given to European immigrants to work and live in Latin America
  - based on racial hierarchy and competing in the global economy
- "mejorar la raza"
  - Mestizaje as a means to dilute Blackness
  - try to marry lighter

  - power among Spanish and Criollos
  - created racial hierarchy and middle categories - Mestizos, Mulatos
- anzaldua as transcending vasconcelos 

### Race
- race as a social construction with no inherent biological basis
- Whitening as a legacy of trauma fear and alienation
  - often promoted by Mestizos
  - Dominican Republic and Haiti

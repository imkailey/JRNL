## SPANGLISH
- Spanglish isn't its own language, mostly just using English and Spanish together, respecting the grammar rules of both
- a lot of people discourage Spanglish for class and ethnic reasons
- anthro-political linguists study dialects and languages used primarily by marginalized groups, and unique grammar rules and stuff
  - these people studied Spanglish, mostly Latino people doing bilingualism
  - borrow words and structures of Spanish and English
- Latinos and language being racialized, nonwhite and Spanglish speaking Latinos perceived as contaminated by wider society
- some people think that the term Spanglish is crude, but it's been reclaimed by some groups and isn't insulting for the most part
- Spanglish is similar to other ways people borrow and mix Spanish and other languages across the world
- generally it's interesting and cool

### Gender again <!-- join this with the other gender section later-->
- How do we unglue gender from binaries?
  - we try to take small steps at a time to make things more socially acceptable and allow for more options for people 
- Forms we fill out, ways that we identify, ways that we are gendered by others
- Is our society in tune with these issues?  How does privilege work via gender?
  - in some ways and to some extent, often when cis people try to be woke on these issues without the consult of trans and nonbinary people they can mess stuff up while trying their best
- Rubin: The Traffic in Women (mid-1970s)
  - Dream of "an androgynous and genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one's sexual autonomy is irrelevant to who one is, what do does, and with whom one makes love."
  - not necessarily a huge fan like im a woman and trans people will still exist in this world, and we need to not forget that 

### Senate Bill 8
- September 1, 2021 – bans abortion in Texas after six weeks
  - looks as though it will get overturned, but it is still bad and worrying
- Allows people across the country to sue anyone who helps someone get an abortion after six week in Texas – includes doctors, partners, friends, family members or abortion fund volunteers
  - this is so weird
- $10,000 minimum reward for every successful lawsuit
  - it can only be enforced by a civil suit being filed against an individual

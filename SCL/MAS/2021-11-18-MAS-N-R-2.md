  - Often put to work on plantations without pay
  - like old slavery

- often policing in the last forty years been used on Latino communities and other marginalized communities to quell dissent
- a lot of this didn't grow under bush, but Clinton and like three bills that sucked
- these acts did:
  - reduced the amount of assistance for the poor
  - cracked down on drugs, making them felonies
  - reduced work and educational opportunities for people convicted of felonies and people who are undocumented

- tough on crime

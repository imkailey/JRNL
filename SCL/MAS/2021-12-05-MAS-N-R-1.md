Incarceration
- The history of incarceration in the United StatesIs racialized and recent
- it stayed mostly static from the founding of the country until the 70s, after which there was a 5x increase

Opinions
- I don't like the parallel between abolitionists and prison abolitionists
- it makes it feel as though all prison is on the same level as slavery
- I do get that a lot of people are held unjustly in prison on non violent drug charges for way too long, but it doesn't constitute the same level of slavery that existed earlier
- I do agree a lot with its conclusions, but there's an underlying assumption that prison abolition is a direct continuation of the work of people working to abolish slavery, when the two issues aren't really that comparable
- generally abolitionists weren't ok with any form of slavery existing at all, while most prison abolitionists want to move towards a more rehabilitative form of a justice system
- this would lead to the end of prisons as we see them in the United States currently, but there would still be involuntary confinement of people who break certain laws for a set amount of time. This still constitutes a prison, and this is why I don't see a direct parallel between slavery abolitionists and prison abolitionists.

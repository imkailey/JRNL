## housing 
- in the past, redlining affected Black people primarily, but also affected Latino people
- housing projects were designed for POC and with minimal resources
- down payments decide whether can get home
- wealth is generally generational
- a lot of generational wealth is held in home value
- 1968 is the fair housing act
  - often redlining is still done off the books
### Latinos and housing
- Latinos remain largely invisible in the housing narrative
- rules about segregation and housing discrimination include Latins and influence their access
- barrios in the southwest created fromm the processes of colonial expansion and forced displacements
  - not just where Latinos lived
- Puerto Rico how to house "tropical populations" came from housing strategies for Latino populations
### forms of housing

- private market that incentivises buying homes
- coops

  - Latinos excluded due to housing discrimination, lang barriers
- challenges to segregation and housing sites in black areas left out Latinos
### housing crisis
- housing crisis affected Latino people a lot
- black and Latino families targetted

## Structural Inequality
<!--missed this lecture, Madison came over-->

### Question
- How can race and ethnicity shape how people are treated by US institutions today?

### Institutional Patterns and Transformations
- Issues of race and ethnicity are embedded in how these institutions operate
- Manifestations of racial stratification have become more subtle
- Causes and consequences more complex
- Five Institutions: Housing, Education, Labor Markets, Religion, Criminal Justice System

### Housing - History
- Prior to 1968 - laws and public policies kept nonwhites out of white neighborhoods
- Neighborhood associations and real estate industry used prohibited white owners from selling to nonwhites
- Gov’t policies constructed in response to white opposition to blacks and Latinos moving in
- 1968 Fair Housing Act – end of legal housing segregation

### Housing
- Residential segregation – do blacks and whites want to live with their own?
- White flight – where whites are moving to and not from is crucial
- Whites are significantly less likely to move into a neighborhood where minority residents are already living
- What is driving residential segregation?

### Racial Preferences - Theories
- Black preferences?
  - Even if whites had no preference, segregation persists because black people want to live with their own race
  - BUT, studies find black people have the lowest in-group preference (when compared to Asians and Latinos)
  - What drives preferences – desire to live among one’s own kind with shared cultural and values, racial hostility and discrimination in white neighborhoods?  
- White preferences?
  - Whites object to the conditions they associate with living with minorities
  - “Racial proxy” considerations – minority neighborhoods are run down, low property values, and suffer from high crime
  - Not because they want to avoid minorities
  - Others say that that objections to integrated neighborhoods may not be racially benign

### 2013 HUD Report
- Latino renters are informed of 12.5 percent fewer units and shown 7.5 percent fewer units than whites
- One agent told a white tester: “I’m not prejudiced but I wouldn’t recommend living in South Albuquerque...too many Hispanics. The further south you go the more you run into.”
- Less Segregation:
  - Enforcement of anti-discrimination protections
  - Education
    - Availability and desirability of diverse neighborhoods
    - Affordable housing development
    - Open up exclusive communities
    - Preserve affordable options in gentrifying neighborhoods
    - Neighborhood reinvestment—to equalize the quality of services, resources, and amenities in minority neighborhoods
    - New incentives-to encourage and nurture stable diversity

### Housing – Discrimination Theories
- Experiments - couples of same qualifications but different races
  - discriminatory treatment towards minorities
- Subtle forms – giving fewer options, showing fewer units or steering towards minority neighborhoods, loan denial  
- Treatment – when whites have flaws in credit histories they are given information to help them fix the flaws
- Decision to help families behind in payments vs foreclosure
- If discretion can be exercised blacks and Latinos are at a disadvantage
- Contributes to segregation and barriers to home ownership  
- Redlining – differential placement of branch offices, advertising approaches, and pre-application procedures
  - Few banks competing for minority loans, higher interest rates and less favorable terms for borrowers
- People of color perceived as higher risk borrowers
- More often rejected, get higher interest loans, become higher risk borrowers

### Housing - Economics
- High income blacks were just as segregated from high income whites as poor blacks from poor whites
- Some progress but racial gulf in wealth remains
  - Median wealth of white households 18 times that of Latinos
- Homeownership is key to wealth accumulation
- Suppressed housing values
- Homeownership - educational access for children, financial resources for self-employment & effective participation in the political process

### Latino segregation patterns & gentrification
- Latinos – less segregated from whites than blacks but differs on subgroup
- Puerto Ricans are more segregated than Mexicans and Cubans
- Revitalization of inner city neighborhoods (gentrification)
- Will this decrease segregation or re-create patterns?

### Education
- Civil rights successes turned on its head
  - Legal battles now seek to dismantle integration policies
- Challenges to affirmative action and the ending of many court-ordered desegregation plans
- Schools at center of racial policy issues
  - equalize school funding
  - institute a voucher system
  - change bilingual education

### Education and Latinos
- Latinos fastest group of public school students
  - 305% increase since 1968
  - Nonwhite majorities in west and southwest
- Laws bar children of illegal immigrants from receiving public services, bilingual education & affirmative action
- Latinos – highest dropout and lowest graduation rates
  - Subpar bilingual education, poor schooling and resources
  - 75% of students with limited English proficiency are Latino
- More Latinos may lead to reexaminations of public education in the U.S.?

### Education - Segregation
- Racial segregation intensified during the 1990s
- Intensified in the south
  - Success with integration due to mandated desegregation reversing
- All schools show evidence of less inter-racial exposure since 1986
- Whites are most segregated group and minorities more likely to attend schools with concentrated poverty

### Education – Quality and Quantity
- Quality and quantity of education
  - Gaps have closed considerably for HS graduates
  - College attainment still has large gaps
- Latinos: 42% as likely to get a BA/BS and 38% to get an advanced degree
  - Rates differ widely among nationality

### Quality of Education
- Schools with high minority enrollment
  - less likely to have internet access in classrooms
  - more students per computers
  - under-qualified instructors
  - long-term substitutes to fill teacher vacancies
  - less likely to take the SAT or ACT
- Less access to
  - instructional materials
  - safe facilities
  - college prep curricula
  - AP courses

### Educational Disparities– Some Causes
- Not a product of direct action to limit opportunities
  - segregation of communities
  - concentration of poverty
  - dependence of local property taxes to fund schools
  - whites aversion to sending their children to minority schools
- 15% of segregated white schools had concentrated poverty and 88% of segregated minority school were predominantly poor

### Studies on Education
- Individual level factors:
  - cultural deficiencies
  - community or family factors
- Institutional culture
  - school practices
  - personnel
  - schools support some families more than others
  - resource disparities in schools and communities shape different outcomes

### Questions
- How do we learn about race in schools?
- How are students racial identities and understandings shaped by explicit and hidden curricula, interracial interactions, and experiences in and across school buildings?

### Labor Markets
- Unemployment gaps have not improved
- Unemployment higher for blacks than Latinos
- Unemployment now – 6.5% for for Latinos
###  4.2% for whites
###  9.5% for blacks
-

### Not only unemployment…
- Minorities overwhelmingly represented in the government sector
  - Face less race-based disadvantage relative to those in the private sector and less wage discrimination
- Public sector has more egalitarian employment practices than the private sector – but these jobs are often the first to go
- Remain overrepresented in lower-status occupations
- Sectors with progress are midrange and lower run white collar jobs – office clerical and sales jobs
- Inequalities persist at the top and the bottom

### Question
- What accounts for job discrimination?  Does it exist?

### Labor Markets – The Theories
- Job allocation among minorities is a color-blind function of supply-side characteristics such as education skill and individual preferences
- Racial discrimination is an individual anomaly rather than an entrenched feature of US society
- Blacks and Latinos lower on the indicators- problem will be solved with increased rates of education
- Labor market attainment is a function of social structure and demand side characteristics
- Studies show resumes with white sounding names are 50% more likely to receive callbacks – uniform across all job categories
- Negative assumptions based on their perceptions of race and discrimination in the work place
- Characteristics of minority jobs
  - tokenism or tracking mechanisms
  - College educated blacks in professional and managerial positions that involve managing or delivering services to other minorities
  - Functionally segregated within the job
  - Subtle discrimination
  - Networks - minorities excluded from the relaxed social interactions with whites

### Question
- What is the most segregated institution in this country?

### Religion
- Racial reconciliation to integrate churches
- Blacks look at individual and structural racism, whites @ individual reconciliation
- Little progress in the development of interracial churches
- 10% are interracial – mostly non-Christian
- Past exclusion led to the formation of minority controlled organizations and institutions – birth of the black church
- Asian segregation – responding to racialization in the US and recognizing that Asian is a salient category

### Criminal Justice System
- 2000: 28% of black males entered state or federal prison in their lifetime, 16% of Hispanic males and 4.4% of whites
- Blacks and Latinos 58% of all prisoners in 2008
- Huge increases in expenditures in the justice system, policing and corrections $9 billion in 1982 to $49 billion in 1999
- 1980 – 2008 # of people incarcerated quadrupled – 500,000 to 2.3 million
- US is 5% of population and 25% of prisoners worldwide

### A Few Points…
- Criminal justice processes: reflections and reinforcements of our larger racialized social system
- Minorities and whites have different relations with and perceptions of the police
- Biases increase the likelihood of criminal conviction and incarceration
- Crime rates have not risen proportionate to incarceration rates
- Minorities are under-protected and over punished

### Drug Offenses
- Mandatory sentencing laws for drug crimes
  - Maryland and Illinois 90% of state prison drug offender admissions were black
- 5 times as many Whites are using drugs as blacks – blacks are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of Whites
- 38% of those arrested for drug offenses, and 59% of those in state prison for a drug offense are black

### Sentencing Disparities
- Missouri - a person who sells 425 grams of powder cocaine faces same charge and sentencing as someone who sells 2.5 grams of crack cocaine
  - Both crimes have mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years
- Black people serve virtually as much time in prison for a drug offense (58.7 months) as whites do for a violent offense (61.7 months)

### Latinos and Incarceration
- Nearly 1 in 3 (32%) persons held in federal prisons is Hispanic
- Latinos men 4 times as likely to go to prison as white
- In some regions Latino male arrestees are the least likely to have their cases dismissed
- State & Local: Latinos are incarcerated at nearly twice the rate of whites,
  - some states higher: 7 times higher in CT and PA
###  6 times in MA & ND

### Criminal Justice and Latinos
- Involvement of Hispanic immigrants in crime is less than that of U.S. citizens
- Latinos are arrested nearly four times as often as whites for drug possession
  - Government records consistently indicate that whites are more likely than any other group to use and sell drugs

### Causes?
- Numbers alone do not suggest discrimination
- 1980s laws: greater police surveillance and aggressive law enforcement in minority communities
- Selective prosecution of cases by state and federal court officials
- Distrust of justice system may make black and Latino defendants less inclined to seek trial
- Language barriers for Latinos
- Latinos are significantly more likely to be low-income (61% of Hispanics, 49% of blacks and 26% of whites)

### Consequences
- Impact of decades of incarceration on nonwhite communities
  - Job acquisition, deportation, disqualification from public housing, welfare and financial aid for education
  - Inability to successfully integrate into society
  - Children with incarcerated parents
    - child development, family and community dynamics strain on relevant social institutions
- Access to the ballot - between ¼ and 1/5 of black males have lost their access to the ballot  
- Diluted power of individuals in prisoners’ home districts & inflated influence of voters in rural districts
- Prison has not been proven as a rehabilitation for behavior, 2/3 of prisoners will reoffend

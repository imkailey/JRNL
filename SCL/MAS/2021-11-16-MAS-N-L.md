## Affirmative Action - United States

### Following the Civil Rights Act:
- "You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” -Lyndon Johnson, 1965

### Historical Background
- Nixon requires universities to report minority enrollment figures
  - Suggested race conscious admissions were not only permissible, but mandatory
- Universities motivated to remedy past racial discrimination, to educate minority leaders and to create diversity on campuses

### Historical Background
- University of California Regents v. Bakke - 1978
  - Court ruled that fixed racial quotas were illegal but allowed the use of race as one factor in college admissions
- Race-based policies became widespread
- Higher-education organizations and traditional civil rights groups: racial admissions policies are essential to ensure racial and ethnic diversity at the nation's elite universities
- Opponents argue it promotes reverse discrimination

### Arguments
- NAACP LDF – “If we are not conscious of selecting minority students, they're not going to be there.”
- “It's immoral. It's illegal. It stigmatizes the beneficiary. It encourages hypocrisy.  It lowers standards. It encourages the use of stereotypes”
- Higher-education officials: they should have discretion to explicitly consider race (along with other factors)
  - “Ensures a fully representative student body and provides the best learning environment for an increasingly multicultural nation and world”

### Michigan Case
- 2003  - University of Michigan
  - Law School policy upheld
  - College policy struck down
- The law school system found constitutional (5-4)
  - Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: because it was narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of attaining diverse student body
- College admissions unconstitutional (6-3)
  - Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist: “college's admissions system awarded minority candidates a fixed numerical bonus without individualized consideration of the applicants‘ backgrounds and records”

### President of Univ. of Michigan:
- “Racial and ethnic diversity is one part of the core liberal educational goal.  People have different educational experiences when they grow up as an African-American, Hispanic or white.” –President Bollinger

### The Judges:
- O'Connor: race-conscious admissions policies should not be permanent
- Colleges and universities should include “sunset provisions” and "periodic reviews" to determine whether racial preferences are still needed to achieve student body diversity
  - “We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.“
- Thomas referred to diversity as "classroom aesthetics,”
  - The majority made "no serious effort" to explain its educational benefits. In practice, he said, racial preferences provoked resentment among unsuccessful applicants while most blacks admitted under the policies were "tarred as undeserving."

### Michigan Case: Admission Bias?
- Admissions uses standardize tests criticized as biased against students of color
- Preferences given to
  - Children of Michigan alumni - disproportionately white
  - Applicants from underrepresented parts of the state
- Are Michigan's admissions policies racially discriminatory because they had a "disparate impact" on minorities?
- Supreme Court, in Bakke: racial classifications were constitutional as remedy for proven discrimination

### Students Bring Evidence of Discrimination
- University refused to desegregate fraternities and sororities until the 1960s
- Allowed white students to refuse to room with black students
- Did not hire its first black professor until 1967
- Black students reported continuing discrimination and racial hostility through the 1980s and into the '90s
- 2016 – 6% of student body is Latino – up from 4.5%

### The Bush Percentage Plans
- Texas adopted the 10 percent rule under George W. Bush - promises a spot at the University of Texas for anyone graduating in the top 10% of the class
- Florida adopted the same policy for the top 20% under Jeb Bush
- Is this dishonest? Critics argue it works because of segregated schools and neighborhoods

### Texas Affirmative Action
- After affirmative action programs were outlawed in Texas in 1995, the University of Texas Law School Latino student enrollment cut in half
- Ten percent plan:
  - Latinos largest and fastest growing segment of Texas' population
  - Plan to increase college access to a wide spectrum of Texas' population
- Results: an annual decrease in Latino applicants of up to 309 at UT, and nearly 500 at TAMU

### University of Texas
- Fisher vs UT Austin
  - Justices ruled 4-3 rejecting Fisher’s claim that she was denied admission because she was white in 2008
  - Upheld policy: 75% of new freshman class through top 6% rule
    - Remainder of students chosen through holistic review where race is considered a factor
- Universities are required to prove consideration of race serves an education benefit and there is no ”race-neutral” way to do it
- Students for Fair Admissions and Edward Blum filed similar suits against UT in 2018 and 2020 (also against Harvard and UNC)

### Class vs. Race-Based?
- Some have argued that giving preferences to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds could target minority students
- Others cite that poor minority students are less likely to do well academically then poor white students
- Can we have a class-based approach to ensuring diversity and/or equality?

### Diversity vs. Discrimination
- Following the Michigan case, race conscious policies shifted to increase diversity rather than remedy discrimination
- Should affirmative action policies in universities be used to remedy discrimination against minorities?

### University of California
- 1995 – Prop 209 - University of California Board of Regents - the policy-making body of the state university system:
  - Abolished racial and sexual preferences in admissions by fall 1997
- Resolution submitted by Ward Connerly & supported by Republican governor, Pete Wilson
- Voters approved the measure, 54 percent to 46 percent, in November 1996

### Admissions Change
- UC Berkeley: 3% black, 14% Latino
- UCLA: 39% Asian, 20% Latino, 4% black

### California Case
- Walter Robinson, UC Berkeley's director of undergraduate admissions, blames voter-approved Proposition 209 for the drop in minority enrollment
- "Private universities can identify and target students that public universities, under Prop. 209, can‘t.  It's one of the most frustrating things in my 30 years of being a higher education professional."

### Arizona Case
- Arizona 2010: Proposition 107
  - Bans consideration of race, ethnicity or gender by units of state government, including public colleges and universities
- Passed with just under 60 percent support
- Arizona's universities have many programs for minority students, some of which could be challenged.
- “Affirmative action wasn't meant to be a perpetual-motion machine. The policy served an important purpose, making up for missing opportunities in education and the workplace. But over time, the drawbacks have come to outweigh the advantages. Voters should pull the plug."
- Only one state — Colorado — has rejected in a statewide vote a proposed ban on the consideration of race and ethnicity

### Labor Market Disparities
- 69% of all doctors are white men, 22% are white women, 4% are Black, and 5% are Latino
- 70% of all lawyers are white men, 24% are white women, 3% are Black, and 3% are Latino
- 80% of all architects are white men, 16% are white women, 1% are black, and 1% are Latino
- 85% of all engineers are white men, 8% are White women, 4% are Black, and 3% are Latino

### Obama on Affirmative Action:
- Obama argued that race conscious policies have not been “nearly as helpful to minorities or damaging to whites as they have been portrayed.”
- "Crude quotas are unnecessary and constitutionally impermissible.  But I do think that there are still circumstances in which on a college admissions or on a hiring decision, taking into account issues of past discrimination or taking into account issues of diversity of a workforce or a student body can still be appropriate."

### Trump & Affirmative Action
- 2018 – Trump eliminates Obama era guidance on AA
- Canceled documents calling on superintendents and college to consider race when diversifying campuses
  - Strongly encourages “the use of race-neutral methods”
- Harvard: “we will continue to vigorously defend our right and of all colleges to consider race as one factor among many.”

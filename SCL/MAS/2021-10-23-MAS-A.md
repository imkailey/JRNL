### current border crisis
- a huge amount of Hatian migrants are at the United States-Mexico border 
- Consider This from NPR says many are moving from Chile due to the pandemic affecting the economy and anti immigrant sentiment is rising. 
- washington post says Haiti is a country with extreme political, economic and humanitarian problems, including most recently an assassinated president and a deadly earthquake. 
  - huge increase over the last few months
- many of the haitians at the border were from the 2010 earthquake, and are moving to the United States from South America for many reasons
  - a migrant from chile can expect to make 3.5x more than they were
  - it is a combination of deteriorating 
    - economic, 
	- social and 
	- sometimes security situations 
	- in the countries these Haitians have been living in
  - As well as the perception that under the Biden administration, it might be easier to get into the United States
- Until recently, they’ve been stopped by the Mexican government at that country’s southern border from getting any farther. For reasons that immigration experts are still untangling, those defenses aren’t holding as well.
- they aren't given the ability to file for asylum due to citing title 42 for the pandemic

- Haitians camped in Del Rio, Tex., are sleeping outdoors under a bridge as they wait for the government to apprehend and process them, in the hope of claiming asylum.
- But to get food, to charge their cellphones and maybe get cash from a relative, they have to go back to the Mexican side of the border.
- That seems to be where these Haitians were coming from when a Border Patrol agent on horseback tried to catch them. The agents, The Washington Post reports, were seen swinging the horses’ reins (they did not have whips) and didn’t appear to strike anyone.
- Other video showed a Border Patrol agent on a horse shouting an obscenity as he tried to clear a child away.
- But United States officials have suspended horse patrols in the area to avoid anymore images like this.

- This summer, the Biden administration granted temporary protected status to thousands of Haitians who were already in the United States illegally, citing 
  - “extraordinary and temporary conditions” in Haiti, such as: 
    - “a deteriorating political crisis, 
	- violence, and 
	- staggering human rights abuses.” 
  - In 2010, the government took similar action after the earthquake in Haiti.
  - Perhaps that fed the false perception among Haitian migrants that they could seek a home in the United States now

- Now many of these Haitians apprehended at the border are getting transported back to Haiti — many of whom haven’t lived there in years. Some of them told The Washington Post they were shackled on flights home.

- Ad into the United States in “very, very large numbers.” The camp is down to an estimated 4,000 peops their plight draws national attention, a United States official told the Associated Press that thousands of Haitians living at the bridge are being releasele now, reports The Post’s Nick Miroff.

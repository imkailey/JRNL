### History of immigration law
- 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act
  - Removed quota system (meant to limit European immigration)
  - Awarded eastern hemisphere countries equal number of visas
  - 20,000 visas to western hemisphere
  - Unlimited visas for family reunification – most immigrants were Asian and Latino who petitioned for family members to come
- 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act
  - In response to large migration flows from the south
  - Illegal for employers to hire unauthorized workers
  - Legalized immigrants here since 1982 & seasonal workers (2.7 million approved)
- 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act
  - Increased number of visas available
  - Doubled size of border patrol (funding today is 15 times 1990 budget)
  - Decreased opportunities for appeal against deportation orders
  - Mandatory detention for “criminal aliens”
  - Retroactive deportation of non-citizens previously convicted of crimes
- Only one thing has slowed unauthorized migration to the U.S. : economic growth in Latin America

### Anti-immigration sentiment
- Minuteman Project – vigilante group formed to patrol border
  - “We need to round them immigrants up…they have no problem slitting your throat and taking your money or selling drugs to your kids or raping your daughters, and they are evil people” –President
- Increase in hate crimes against Latinos increased in early 2000s
  - Increases since 2016 (80% in CA)
  - Mass shooting in El Paso: gunman fighting against “Hispanic invasion of Texas”
- Anti-immigrant speech more prevalent in public sphere since 2016 campaign, but not new….

### History of Anti-immigrant sentiment
- 1994 – Prop 187 – denied health care and social services to unauthorized immigrants and their children
  - Passed with 60% of vote
  - Marches, school walkouts and mass protest in California as a result
- Merging of law enforcement and homeland security records (secure communities) has history via mass deportations by LAPD in early 20th century

### Immigration Crackdown
- New immigration laws seek to involve the state and local police force in control
  - Alabama, Utah, Indiana, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina
  - Provisions:
   - Give police the right to check immigration status of anyone stopped
   - Ask schools to check immigration status
   - Penalties to employers
   - Penalties to those renting to or seeking immigrants for employment
- What are the consequences of police enforcing immigration laws?

### Consequences
- Fear among immigrants
- Fleeing to other states
- Parents keeping children from going to school
- Loss in jobs particularly in agriculture and the service sector
- Racial/ethnic profiling

### Anti-Immigration - Pro-Jobs?  
- Alabama: “This is a jobs bill….we have a problem with an illegal workforce that displaces Alabama workers.  We need to put those people back to work.”
- But, unemployment did not decrease in affected sectors (agriculture, construction, food services) after law passed
- These sectors only willing to pay certain wages

### Questions
- Does amnesty attract further immigration?
- Will immigrants self-deport if policies do not support their integration into American society?
- “We need a functioning legal immigration system, a system that has the necessary legal channels for a person to emigrate here whether or a job or his family.  Without a solution the only ones who are winning are the crooked employer who is more than happy to exploit the undocumented, poor third-country worker”

### change in laws
- Immigration laws began to change in the 1980s
- Congress 1996 – denied undocumented most federal benefits – food stamps, family assistance and social security – states can do the same
  - Established E-verify
  - Money for border patrol and border fence
  - Bars re-entry of deportee for 5 years
- Change in laws produced more grassroots work to challenge backlash

### The Spring 2006 Immigration Rights Protests
-
- 5 million marched in 150 cities
- Made by a new organizational
- coalition
- March succeed in removing criminalization (felony) of illegal status from the debate – HR 4437
  - Currently, entering the U.S. without documentation is a misdemeanor but remaining without authorization is not a crime.

### Electoral Consequences
- The protests and concerns about the immigration shaped the federal elections in 2006, 2008, and 2010
- Their outcomes have not been consistent
- Has immigration become a more important policy issue in the US after the 2012 election?

### Candidates, Campaigns, and the Protests
- Immigration was slightly more relevant in the 2008 races
- But muted in the presidential election 2008
- Clearest effect of national debates on immigration policy appeared in Republican presidential primaries
- Democrats were quieter on immigration issues – Why?

### New Resources for Community Mobilization
- What were the constituents of the coalition that brought together the 2006 march?
- Religious organizations, unions, radio, smaller associations
-  
- Objectives of the marchers for comprehensive immigration reform ultimately rest on congressional action and organizational activity

### Why were the Mobilizations Broad?
- The people were ready
- Ethnic media played a pivotal role
- Groundwork greased the wheels
- The coalitional broadened

### Backlash
- Anti-immigrant forces used the images of the marches to galvanize their base
  - Advocated for more enforcement against immigrants
- Anti-immigrant groups broadened their activities to both federal and local level
  - Sought out legislators to enact anti-immigration laws
  - Thought to increase votes
- “Self-deportation”
- Bush administration stepped up immigration reinforcement
  - Large-scale raids
  - Increase criminal prosecution of immigration violations
  - Caused fear among those vocal early in 2006
- One in ten Latinos reported being stopped in 2008 and asked about their immigration status

### Impacts of the Marches on Policy Makers
- Marches framed mobilizations as part of a political movement
- They fostered great optimism among community members and immigrant supporters
- The optimism dissipated as comprehensive immigration reform failed to gain traction in a divided Congress

### DREAM Act
- What is the Dream Act?
- Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act (2001)
- Children that have grown up in the US are innocent of immigration violations
- Those brought before the age of 16 and lived in the US for 5 years – path to citizenship (permanent residency),  if they graduate from HS and attend 2 years in college or military

### Dreamers
- comprehensive immigration reform bill fails – brought to vote Senate but was one vote shy of making it to the floor
  - Bill reintroduced each year, but never comes to a vote
  - 2012 – sit in at Obama’s campaign headquarters to protest deportations (73% of Mexican origin)
- Obama introduced DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)
  - DREAMers could apply for 2-year regularization of status with right to work and possibility of renewal
  - 800,000 have been approved
  - 2017 Trump rescinded DACA, overturned by courts

### Question
- What should immigration reform look like for DREAMers and others?
- Does the DREAM act go far enough?

### Public Opinion on Immigration
- Americans have ambivalent and contradictory views on immigration
  - Led to the failure to translate the protests into policy changes
- The US public generally is inconsistent towards immigration:
  - Immigration at current level is too high but that immigrants already in the US are an asset
  - Strongly opposing unauthorized migration and supporting increasing barriers to this
  - Supporting a path to legal residence over deportation for unauthorized migrants in the US

### The Polls
- The 2006 protests did not alter these pattern and may have strengthened them
- Protests did change patterns for Latinos
- Gallop Poll June 2002-June 2006:
  a. 39-49% - level of immigration should be decreased
  a. 33-39% - level of immigration should be maintained
  a. 12-18% - level of immigration should be increased

### The evolving legacy of the Mass Mobilization
- Naturalization
- Voting
- Dispelling misinformation about immigrants
- Leadership development and building alliances with other communities
  - Center for Community Change – help immigrants learn about the political system, develop advocacy skills, collaborating with orgs in five states
  - Will not accomplish 2nd mobilization but increased voting, naturalization & civic engagement

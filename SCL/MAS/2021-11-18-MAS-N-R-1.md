## Illegality

- different groups of immigrants have been marked as illegal suddenly over the years, and generally it's a distinction made socially and not to the character of the people
- a lot of people who go through the correct process to be legal immigrants can be made illegal through law or executive order
- if deported and come back, that's seen as unlawful reentry and that's illegal and a felony
  - extremely likely if they have family here
  - this is a huge percentage of the crimes undocumented immigrants commit
  - 
- also this is racialized, the top four countries that Latino immigrants come from make up 64% of undocumented immigrants, but makeup 96% of deportations
- people that overstay visas and then our deported it don't have a 3 to 10 year period where they aren't allowed back into the country at all, but people that cross the border are
- efforts to retroactively illegalize people
  - there have efforts to strip people's naturalized citizenship status if they messed up even a little bit on their application
  - efforts to remove citizenship of people who are children of undocumented immigrants
  - efforts to remove green cards
- very gendered and racialized and class based

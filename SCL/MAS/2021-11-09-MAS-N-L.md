## Redistricting

### Redistricting
- The US Census determines districts in each state
- Redistricting according to population changes can occur every ten years
- Districts often not in the interest of communities, but of parties
- After 2010 Census - 8 states gained and 10 lost House seats
- 2020 Census: Texas only state to gain 2 districts

### Section 5 – Voting Rights Act
- Requires certain states and localities to gain federal approval for any voting change to ensure it isn’t discriminatory: “preclearance”
- Needs to be reauthorized regularly by Congress
- 2006 - bipartisan majority of Congress reauthorized Section 5 for 25 years – after view of discrimination in voting
- 2012, Section 5:
  - prevented Texas from enacting the most stringent voter ID law in the country
  - stopped Florida from cutting early voting days which would disproportionately impact African American voters
  - and blocked Texas from redrawing congressional and state legislative districts that diluted minority voting strength.
- Applies to all or part of 15 states which are often called “covered jurisdictions - long history of discrimination

### Voting Rights Act: Shelby County vs Holder
- Section 5 thrown out in 2013 by the Supreme Court
- Majority: "based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day" and that a state cannot be subject to preclearance because of past discrimination.
-  RBG dissent: "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”
- States moved to change their voting laws immediately after case
  - Texas’ voter ID law found in courts to “almost certainly have retrogressive effect: it imposes strict, unforgiving burdens on the poor, and racial minorities in Texas are disproportionately likely to live in poverty”
  - Governor Rick Perry signed new Congressional district maps heavily favoring the Republican Party (would not have passed preclearance)
  - Federal court found these maps were intentionally discriminating against minorities by “cracking” (separating) the Hispanic population of south Texas - into several Republican-leaning districts instead of drawing one majority-Hispanic district

### Voting Rights Act
- Development of majority/minority districts
  - VRA required some consideration of race to avoid “retrogression”
  - New districts that reduce the ability of minority groups to elect their preferred candidate
- Should district lines be drawn to help underrepresented groups get elected?

### Gerrymandering
- Gerrymandering: politically motivated line drawing
- Should partisan gerrymandering be restricted?
- Several cases have gone to the Supreme Court with no clear guidance on what should be done
- Gerrymandering or protecting voter rights?
- As the Latino population grows and the African American population has slower growth, districts can reflect that

### Arguments on line-drawing
- Some groups argue that drawing racial lines cannot be gerrymandering – odd lines bring together “communities of interest”
- Why should districts have geometric shapes?

### Supreme Court
- Shaw vs Reno (1993) – restricted the use of race as a factor in constructing districts
- NC had created a majority minority district – failed to elect a black representative since the 1800s
- O’Connor found the NC district “irrational”
- 2012 after redistricting led by Republican led legislature, GOP picked up 9 out of 13 seats – Democrats cast more ballots

### Citizens Commission
- California: Citizens Redistricting Commission
  - Nonpartisan
  - Must not favor or discriminate against any party
  - Approved by three Republicans, three Democrats and three Independents
  - Created in 2008 (Proposition 11)
  - Second state, after Arizona, to establish a citizens’ redistricting commission

### Florida
- Florida: legislature prohibited from drawing districts
- Law states districts cannot be created that help or hurt a political party or candidate
  - Unenforceable?

### 2010 District Changes
- Florida gained two seats
  - Republicans hold both houses in state legislature
- Groups fought against partisan line drawing
- 2015 – Supreme Court approved new districts drawn by coalition
  - League of Women Voters, Common Cause of Florida and others
  - Rejected Republican led efforts
  - Districts 26 and 27 had new boundaries (Curbelo & Ros-Lehtinen)
- Republicans have the advantage in virtually all of the states that received new districts

### Texas
- Courts found the map violated the Voting Rights Act
- The League of Women Voters called the plan “the most extreme example of racial gerrymandering among all the redistricting proposals passed by lawmakers so far this year.”
- Whites’ share of the population declined from 52 percent to 45 percent but remain the majority in 70 percent of Congressional Districts
  - Senator Eddie Lucio of Brownsville proclaimed "How is it fair that although Anglos only make up 45 percent of our population, but they control 72 percent of our congressional districts? It does not make any sense

###  it is unfair."

### Representation
- Substantive vs. Descriptive
  - Majority-Minority districts ensure the election of a candidate that descriptively represents the voters
  - Surrounding districts can be devoid of minorities
  - Should districts have some minorities to which white legislators are accountable?
  - Latino representatives: 9.6%
  - African American representatives:12%
  - Asian Americans: 3.2%
  - Women: 24%

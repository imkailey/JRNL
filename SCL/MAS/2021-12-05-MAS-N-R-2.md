Citizenship reading
- starts out explaining modern day states
- along with democracy and citizenship
- a very recent development and concept
- no matter how you slice it, modern states eventually have people living in them that are some degree of non citizen, and therefore not a person to some extent in the eyes of the law
- the US didn't originally intend for poc to be citizens
  - native people were seen as barbaric
  - Black people were seen as property
  - both seen as unable to govern
  - not granted citizenship at first
- because all this, the US democracy had white supremacy at it's root
- during the US Mexico war the US wanted the most land they could with the fewest Mexicans on it
  - defined where we drew the border
  - we only let White Mexicans become citizens at the time for the most part, but it was up to the states
  - often people stole their property and nothing was done about it
- we fucked over Puerto Rican ppl
  - They still can't vote if they live on the island, and we only gave them citizenship as they started to try to gain independence

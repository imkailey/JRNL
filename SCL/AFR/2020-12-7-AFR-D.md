Week 1-2 discussion post
Please comment on at least two readings from weeks 1 +2 with the following:
1. What are the main points of the text?
2. What did you learn from this text?
3. What would be your response to the author/s?
4. Do you have any questions about the readings this week?

I really thought I had responded to this one, but apparently, I never did. Going all the way back to the beginning of *Experiments In A Jazz Aesthetic*, the beginning section was to both explain the history behind the authors spaces, how they worked, and what the fundamental principles were. The principles include a lot of things that want you to get in touch with your body and be here in the here and now, however for me I have a dissociative disorder, and so I can’t really do that well. I have still taken a lot of advice into my own creation from this, however. The advice about heading into your emotions but be close enough to the shore you don’t get pulled out by the current is very good advice, and I’ve been able to get better at this technique without hurting myself too often. 
The second reading I will talk about is “Poetry Is Not A Luxury,” by Audre Lorde. This poem primarily focuses on how women of color have used their voices in the past as both a means of expressing their hurting, but also to get things changed. I learned some of the power of true raw emotion, and how often those who don’t suffer as bad don’t tend to feel that all too much.

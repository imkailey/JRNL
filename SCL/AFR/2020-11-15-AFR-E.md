Your paper should connect "The Colored Museum" to one feminist and one performance concept covered in class. It should respond to the questions:

1. What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"?

2. What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any?

3. How does it illuminate the lives of Black women?

4. How does its aesthetics and use of dramatic form relate with (or depart from) those covered in class?

Your paper should be proofread and well-argued. Draw on specific moments or elements from the performance to corroborate your claims and connect these to specific quotes from the readings.

### Notes

 ---

#### the drums (1,4?)
- throughout the performance, there's the symbol of the drums an how they were taken away when Black people were enslaved. they don't just appear when brought attention to; throughout whole performance. (go thru and look for when they appear maybe)
   - **look in the script to see if the cues are in there**
   - look in script for changes
   - **are they a motif?**
- the drums are a symbol of blk people's expression and cultural power; along with the spirituality and ancestry
- in the egg one; her voice is her drums I think?
 - finds out which ex it is
- the drums appear in
 - the end of the os ns one
 - the party ex
 - the celebrity express
 - the ...

#### Portrayals (3)
- think about the different portrayals of Black women throughout the performance
  - during the wig one
    - talk about the hair stuff
    - how can relate to different groups like trans people
    - this ties into the feminism/Black feminism question
  - the different members of the family in the all Black musical
    - gone with the wind
      - first black woman to get an Oscar couldn't go to the screening
      - Hatty Mcdaniel
      - got heat for being stereotype
    - each person has like horse blinders on
    - the mom just wants the house clean
    - reminds kind of like boy scout skit
      - different roles or like archetypes
    - there's a chapter of *Black Feminist Thought* which is about this
    - its literally a show
    - the guys in Blackface in the background
    - time period
  - Miss Roj
    - performative femininity
    - violence against LGBT people
    - femininity
    - how does feminism play into this
    - how marginalization plays into the aggressive character
      - look into aggressive as word used
      - cathartic
    - being that sure of yourself and confident in who you are and the space to be safe in who you are
    - alcoholism
  - the egg one
    - teen pregnancy
    - mom is just awful
    - she's told she isn't special; hammered in
    - but then she is and her kids are
    - the drums
- think about how other races are portrayed; specifically relation to White people
  - all Black musical three guys in Blackface in the background of the tv stuff

#### *Con Flama* Similarities (4)
- demanding for performers and audience
  - for different reasons
  - active readings
  - audience response can change it
- people worked so hard to bring the stuff together
  - kind of like the colored museum?
>  It illuminates one girl's experience, discovering her own heritage and self, but in the process it also illuminates the selves of many others, their cultures and their lineages and their struggles, in ways that often mirror the girl's.
- ***Robert Faires "Review: *Con Flama*"***

 - when we were reading articles about Sharon Bridgforth's *Con Flama*, there was a description of the performance using all of an actors body and using music and something else like color or something to tell as story; I feel this performance uses that a lot too.

 ---

#### Performativity (1,2,?)
- os ns thing; what is it like to be a black man and try to perform Whiteness
- performativity ties in with the Miss Roj exhibit
- trans people and stuff too
- sometimes don't have choice in how we perform ourselves

<!--  -->
#### celebrity express; ex 1 (1)
- the slave ship section at the beginning feels like a disney horror ride as it begins;
  - its interesting they rpesent something so horrifying in such a sanitized way;
  - could be a reference to how wht people see it as not a big deal;
  - shows how blk people's struggles trivialized to the point of almost a carnival/disney ride;
  - used for entertainment
- also the fucking drums

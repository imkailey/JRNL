I'm made to feel like I'm abusing the drugs I don't get pleasure from and need to function; others scoff at my inability to sleep with an extended effort on my part; without the right sounds, pillows, location, or feeling I'm up until four in the morning and not by choice. I often stay up throughout the night and love on a 48 hour day just to please others and make it to things that are in the morning. Sleeping medications don't help; they actually make me have a spout of anxiety and paranoia at three in the morning, monsters filling up my room and snipers at my windows, I just want it to end.

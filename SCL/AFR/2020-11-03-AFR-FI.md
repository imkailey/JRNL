My visualization is either so shallow you're skipping a rock across the surface of a still ocean; other times you get pulled all the way under, into the mariana trench, reality slipping away as you get pulled deeper by the currents

My alters are like the part of Kendrick lamar's lust; the same voice layered over itself multiple times, different tones, pitches, and emotions each their own

---

My subvocalisation is either silent; sometimes yelling different people different things some good some bad some right some wrong some hurt some help; overwhelming silence or sound either way I'm overwhelmed.

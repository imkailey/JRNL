### definitions of public policy
- decisions and actions and commitments on the part of the government
- thomas die said policy is something the governemnt cooses to do or not to do 
  - deliberate decision 
  - not just look at what the govt does but what they dont do

  - it can easily do either and both in different aspects
  - govt has a lot of power

### the policy cycle
#### models of decision making
- rational model
  - weigh all of the possible things and run 
  - criticisms
    - might not know all the facts
    - only really works when you have time to weigh the options

- garbage can 
  - using popular ideas of the time to get through a crisis as best as possible 
  - haphazard, more short term
  - can be really useful
  - criticisms
    - maybe these crises arent as random as we make them out to be
	- we could probably plan for more things in advance
	  - not necessarily as politically popular

- incremental 
  - things change slowly over time 
  - generally happens when things are pretty stable and most people are kinda ok 
  - criticisms 
    - kinda complacent
	- things can go unadressed for a long time 
	- ignoring goal

- punctuated equilibrium 
  - long stretches of no change, short of a lot 
  - can be when theres a change in perspective or the people involved in taking care of an issue

### social welfare policy 
- the u.s isnt necessarily as far behind in welfare spending as other countries

### submerged state
- we don't see everything that the govt does 
- people often dont know whats up
- if people dont know how to get involved or what to change they cant really be politically effective 
- student loans are protected by the govt 
  - would be high risk if not 
- powers of the submerged state obscure the role of the govt and exaggerate that of the market
  - benefits the affluent the most

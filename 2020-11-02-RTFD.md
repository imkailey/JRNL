<!--
For this week, I want you to consider how a contemporary television series, digital show, or other media that is thought of as a series expands on the representation of a previously underrepresented group of people. Explain briefly why you think this is the case.

Questions to consider include:

what factors do you think influenced a studioâ€™s decision, including their profit-driven goals?

Is this a studio courting new audience(s)? Was the representation matched behind the camera, or in the writers room?

Feel free to answer any of these, or to think up your own questions.

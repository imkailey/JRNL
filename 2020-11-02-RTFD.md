<!--
For this week, I want you to consider how a contemporary television series, digital show, or other media that is thought of as a series expands on the representation of a previously underrepresented group of people. Explain briefly why you think this is the case.

Questions to consider include:

what factors do you think influenced a studioâ€™s decision, including their profit-driven goals?

Is this a studio courting new audience(s)?

Was the representation matched behind the camera, or in the writers room?

Feel free to answer any of these, or to think up your own questions.

I don't watch that much tv, but one show I can think of more recently that expanded representation is <i>Steven Universe</i>. <i>Steven Universe</i> was a fantasy cartoon network show that ran from 2013 to 2019, and featured a race of aliens that were all female presenting and that had very obvious lesbian relationships.

I think this representation was one of the first shows aimed at a younger audience that showed normalized gay relationships and treated them like other relationships. </p>

This show had a pretty huge following in the LGBT community during its run. I'm not sure if it was aiming for that audience when it started off, but it totally could've.

I do know that a lot of the writers and creators of the show were LGBT. The executive producer, Rebecca Sugar, I believe is bisexual. I also think the staff pushed for more diversity in their writing, producing, and acting.

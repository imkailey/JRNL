Did I ever tell you I have Dissociative Identity Disorder? [have more than one person in my head] yeah that's why I don't have any memories of anything, especially not before like, two years ago? I'm not sure if I existed three years ago or so; I've changed completely since then i think; its a good thing i think, not as bad of a friend; more caring and inclusive and understanding.

## ch 1

### P. 4
1. deception has always been with us
2. language supercharged our evolution
3. with language came abstract concepts like love, truth, deception
4. modern humans use language both to reflect and transform reality
5. early social life required cooperation and trust ("reciprocal altruism")
6. to fool people in such an environment required genuine skill 

### Introduction P. 5
1. deception had to be used wisely
  - learned how to avoid detection
  - lied infrequently rather than often
  - resisted the urge to tell only self serving lies
  - occasionally used deception to benefit the group as a whole
2. deception is thus an aspect of effective communication
3. truth-tellers and deceivers ask similar questions
  - what information does the audience want?
  - what will make them believe what i want them to believe 
  - how are they most likely to respond to a particular message
  - out of all i *could* say, what do i *want* to say?

### Introduction P. 6
1. effective communication requires *discreetly * employing deception
  - see reults of research by feldman, forrest, and happ (2002 and 2010)
2. we endorse honesty and trust yet regularly deceive because
3. social life depends *in part* on effective deception. otherwise: 
  - imagin a world in which deception was prohibited or didn't exist (the invention of lying)
  - imagine a world in which deception was normalized, culturally or organizationally

### Lying and Deception as Communication P. 8
1. nyberg: deception is a communication tool, means to an end
2. solomon: deception can be harmful, immoral, or neither
3. social harmony sometimes requires effective use of deception 
  - politeness rituals (see "situation"  discussion)
  - respecting feelings (prosocial lies)
  - coping, maintaining control
  - storytelling, interviewing, negotiating
  - protecting privacy 

### Lying and Deception as Communication P. 10
1. "true" doesnt always mean morally correct
2. context matters too: peoples feelings, etc
3. effective communication matters more... and quality of life
4. language is problematic: 
  - arbitrary
  - incomplete
  - abstract
  - imprecise
  - may poorly capture the complexity of reality (words often fail us)
  - terms always relative to people/contexts: Q: how was it? -okay, -great, -crazy, -bad

### Conceiving of Deceiving P. 11
1. terms *lying* and *deception* often used interchangeably
2. as terms, *deception* more ecompassing than *lying*
3. traditional definitions, even in research, are problematic: 
  - dictionaries define historical use, not always the same as the actual meaning
  - definitions, being composed of words, are abstractions anyway
4. there are lots of complicating facors, including: 
  - should lies be defined based on what the deceiver does vs. what the target experiences?
  - can deception occur subconsciously?
  - do good reasons for lying make it justifiable?

### Conceiving of Deceiving P. 12
1. liars and targets often perceive the same event quite differently
  - nixon: "i wasnt lying. i said things that later on seemed to be untrue"
  - oliver north (at the iran-contra hearings) said he used a "different version of the facts"
2. in practice, deception is best defined by key contextual features
  - awareness level
  - information alteration
  - intent
  - the situation
  - effects/consequences 

### Awareness Level (P. 13)
1. was the act performed consciously?
2. most lying is believed to be done while the liar is highly aware 
3. "i dont recall" is therefore a frequent (and weak) defense
  - kevin spacey's "apology" tweet to anthony rapp
  - sen. cory booker **doesnt believe** homeland security secretary (begins @ 1:10)
  - attorney general jeff sessions spoofed on snl weekend update
  - scene from *the wolf of wall street* (2013)

1. we tend to link cognition to awareness 
2. we sometimes give benefit of the the doubt ( and less severe sancitons) to groups whom we perceive as cognitively limited
  - children
  - the elderly
  - people in duress, under stress, or experienceing trauma


### Information Alteration  (P. 14)
1. does message contain info that differs from the original facts? 
2. if so (and more importantly), was the attempt deliberate or not?
3. altered information = lie of commission
4. leaving out key information basically the same = lie of omission
5. "Liars" who believe what theyre saying not seen as deceptive

### Perceptions of Intent P. 15-16
1. intent may matter more than any other factor (e.g., paltering)
2. consider intentional unawareness
3. can we  be lied to by true statements?
4. dliberate omission is still intentional 
5. consider *indirect responses* designed to mask one's true feelings
  - Q: Are you going to the party? A: I'll bet it's going to be a lot of fun. 

### Perceptions of the Stituation (P. 16-17)
1. some situations make the act of lying more likely
  - intense pressure to lie
  - a hostile (or sympathetic) audience
  - tradition (like lies in politics or personal ads)
  - greater incentive/reward for deception vs. truth 
2. some lies are cultural fixtures
  - "the doctor will call you right back"
  - "I'll pay you when i get my check next week"
  - "i never got your text"
  - "I'm not drunk, just buzzed"
  - "i have read and agreed to the terms and conditions"
  - "you will use algebra in real life"

### Terminology
1. reciprocal altruism: a social system based on the idea of mutual aid, requiring cooperation, trust, honesty, and reliability on everyone's part 
2. audience analysis: constructing messages in ways that are most likely to resonate with recievers by first considering the situation from their perspective. one of the ekys to effective communication
3. social lives: the part of our existence that involves interacting with others across all contexts and situations
4. prosocial lies: deception intended primarily for thje benefit of others rather than aid the liar 
5. deception: any behavior considered faudulent, tricky, misleading, etc., including spoken/writtenlies of commission and unspoken lies of omission. even true statements can be considered deceptive if that was the communicator's intention. 
6. indirect responses: a deliberately vague response that encourages audiences to interpret the sender's meaning in a way other than what was intended, while allowing the sender to claim neutrality.

## Ch. 2 
### Introduction (p. 26)
1. "lies" only "exist" inasmuch as they are measured against "truth"
2. understanding deception requires understanding truth 
3. according to Nyberg (1993) "truth": 
  - and its synonyms are a symbol for ceartainty in an uncertain world (Exercise 1)
  - is the product of the human capacity for imagining more than we can actually know 
4. How humans determine what is true: 
  a. truth we **feel**
  b. truth we are **told**
  c. truth we figure out through **reasoning**
  d. truth we **observe**
5. these methods may dominate certain historical eras 
  1. for example, the **age of reason**
  2. compared to what's going on **today** (additional article)
### Truth We Feel (P. 27-28)
1. nonverbal behaviors in others somtimes processed this way: 
  - we interpret the message accurately, but...
  - are unable to verbally articulate what cues were used to decode the message 
2. often described as **"gut"** feelings (**"hunches,"** etc.)
3. there is little rhyme or reason (pun intended)
4. may not even be conscious 
  - "moral dumbfounding" when it comes to value judgements (Haidt, 2001), such as: 
  - "i dont know. I cant expain it. its just wrong"

### Truth We are Told (p. 30)
1. We most often rely on others as a source of truth: 
  - we have to since we dont have time to investigate everything ourselves
  - conversations
  - media sources
  - any external source we choose to believe 
  - basis for the truth bias: believeing that what most sources tell us is true 
2. Reasons for bellieveing these sources (i.e., **"opinion leaders"**)
  - their perception of reality matches ours 
  - they are designated as experts in their field or other type of authority figure 
  - we trust them to weight the accuracy of the information in an unbiased way 
3. sources and their credibility change with age: 
  - children normally rely on parents to determine truth 
  - adults use multiple sources, adding expectations about credibility and honesty (next slide) 

### reasoning as a source of truth (p. 32-34)
1. often a function of formal rules and standards (e.g., mathematics)
2. but the use of formal thinking does not gurantee accuracy 
  - widely accepted versions for reasoning usually go unchallenged
  - what we're really doing is saying "most of us accept and agree upon this system" 
  - our collective faith in them doesnt gurantee that the formulas are any good 
3. when rules are less explicit, conclusions vary among groups 
  - different lines of reasoning can produce dramatically different conclusions
  - consider social issues such as gun control, voter ID laws, teen pregnancy, etc. 
  - some "resoning" uses only information that supports one's beliefs 
  - incorrect inferences can be reasoned from accurate observations
  - discounting the role *chance* and *coincidence* play in everyday life, looking for causes instead
  - noticing something frequently (and other forms of personal experience) are overrated 
  - despite perceptions, consistency isn't necessarily truthful and inconsistency deceptive 

### the truth we observe (p. 34-36)
1. sensory based (primarily sight and sound)
2. our senses serve as a way of "certifying" truth/accuracy 
3. jurors believe eyewitness testimony about 80% of the time
  - eyewitness or heard testimony can even trump the testimony of experts
  - eyewitness identification is most damning form of evidence used against defendants
  - 75% of first 292 convicts exonerated by DNA evidence had been misidentified by eyewitnesses
  - remarkable story of **ronald cotton and jennifer thompson** (part 1 and part 2) 
  - (exercise 2)
4. our brains are not recording like cameras 
5. we are subject to **change blindness** and **inattential blindness** 
6. what our brains are **really doing**: 
  - continually trying to make snse out of more stimuli than we can possibly handle
  - goal is creation of a meaningful narrative
  - disregards stimuli that dont seem to make sennse
  - view the classic **invisible gorilla** experiment (simons and chabris, 1999)

### the observer and observation conditions (P. 36-39)
1. accuracy affected by various characteristics, including gender
2. cognitive factors like **confirmation bias**
3. motivation matters too 
4. most cannot recall details past events
5. mood and **stress level** can affect accuracy 
6. physical environment (lighting, etc.) matters too 
7. case study: crash of **american airlines 587** (and next)
8. even **measurement** can be problematized

### memory (P.39) 
1. perceiving (observing) is hard enough
2. but then comes remembering
3. **misconception:** memories are stoed/filed like recordings
4. research suggests otherwise; memory is a **reconstructive** process:
  - blends aspects of original recording with other past and ongoing experiecnes
  - memory is changeable, neither precise nor permanent
  - memories are like crime scenes; they're messy and should be treated with care
  - information has been forgotten or was never stored to begin with 
  - **false memories** can be added in **various ways** (e.g., **this movie** that sinbad never made)
  - and just imagine what effect fake videos will have 

#### reducing eyewitness misidentification: **best practices** (p. 41)
1. some police departments have modified their photo lineup process 
2. 30-40% of witnesses ID a perpetrator even when the actual suspect isnt included in the lineup 
3. administrators should tell witnesses its ok not to pick someone from the lineup 
4. showing lineup photos sequentially can reduce false IDs by 10%
5. lineups should be administered by someone who does not know suspects identity (or by computer)

#### children are problematic witnesses in court 
1. post **mcmartin,** no longer automatically accepted as credible
  - children often tell stories to please adults, not to be accurate 
  - adults with their own agenda can influence stories children tell 
  - repeated interviews with leading questions can alter details given 
2. american academy of child psychiatry: 36% of charges untrue
3. how old should a child witness be? it's an **open question**
4. **competency tests** often administered before children can testify

### Truth and Certainty (p. 42-44)
- "the whole problem wit hthe world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts" -Bertrand Russell
1. truth is always in process 
2. our degree of certainty varies from one belief to the next 
  - truth is often a question of higher or lower probability (certainty)
  - probabilities can change over time, and with them our certainty 
  - **truths can shift for whole societies** (e.g. attitudes about social issues, politics, morality)
3. this same process holds true for a society's belief system: 
  - opinion percentages in single digits still represent many millions of people 
  - consider the case of copernicus, galileo, and the catholic church
  - pluto was the 9th planet from 1930 until 2006 
  - harmonica was long considered a toy... until it wasnt (see "fun facts" here)
4. even those who think they know should ask quyestions and struggle

## Ch. 3

### why concern ourselves with ethics (p 56)
1. our commitment to what is right fair, good, etc is tested daily
2. these values deserve ongoing, serious reflection
3. some believe the present era is one of great moral and ethical decay
4. see 2017 gallup poll results
  - discussed in the book 
  - found two things 
    - 81%of americans describe the overall moral state of the country as fair or poor 
	- 77% believe moral values are getting worse
5. presidents have lied regularly over 60 years
  - u.s is in a moral recession from parade of dishonesty etc
  - from politics to business to athletics
  - has big lies wach one has told beginning with eisenhower

<!--p56-57-->

1. high profile ethical failures about 
  - see list 
2. widespread cynicism (packer: sense of community "unwinding")
3. josephson institute (2012) polled 23000 high school students about unethical behavior, included questions about lying 
  - 76% lied to a parent about something significant
  - 55% lied to a teacher about something significant 
  - 32% copied an internet document for an assignment 
  - 52% cheated during a test 
  - 74% copied someone else's homework
  - but somehow 81% said "when it comes to doing what is right, im better than most people" 
    - this has to do with cognitive dissonance
    - when our brain separates how we're acting from how we feel about ourselves 

<!--p 58-->

- what feeds into behavior?
- list on p 58 of some of the things 


1. false nostalgia?

  - dubious behaviors have a long history

  - false memory of things that happened 
  - in the past there was bad actors as well 
  - in cultural records, poor ethical behaviors been linked to bad natural happenings 
  - lies around things like slavery and child labor for being profitable, also stuff about native americans 




2. look around
  - students in 1920s little different than those today 
  - ethical violations now far more likely to be made public
  - more people willing to admit it today rather than deny it
  - more formal monitoring of ethics in place now than before 
  - maybe we're just paying more attention 


3. same 2012 poll of students has an upside (see 8th bullet)
  - 99% said its important for peopkle to trust them and to be someone of good standing  
  - 98% said honest and trust is essential in personal relationships 
  - 86% said lying and cheating wasnt worth potential damage to character 

<!--p59-->
1. complicated ethical issues face everyone, not just public figures 

2. complex circumstances require us to regualrly test and modify our values 


3. informatiuon age means more choices about what to communicate 



4. everything we communicate is disseminated and scrutinized widely 



### is it ever right to lie? p59-74

1. no, its never right (absolutist)

  - disrepects humanity and negatively affects character 
  - transgression against divine law 
  - lying about one things means lying about other things 





2. not right to lie except as a last resort 




3. it is right to lie when it serves your purpposes (machiavellian 





4. sometimes lying is right, sometimes it isnt 
  - motives matter 
  - so do the consequences 


### answer 1: no its never right to lie 

largely a part of european judeochristian tradition 




1. no exceptions 



2. today, most are critical of this 



3. more commmon in earlier eras 

  - augustine d430 
    - early leader in fourth century
	- hard line 
	- eight types of lie in a hierarchichal form 
	- violating it a lot
	- losing membership 
  
  
  - thomas aquinas d 1274 
    - reformed things 
	- narrowed to three 
	- all deception is bad, but some lies can be forgiven 
    - three types 
	  - lies as jokes
	  - lies that help people 
	  - lies malicious
  
  - john wesley d 1791 
  
  - john stuart mill 
    - nineteenth century 
	- utilitarian 
	- british 
	- spock 
	- an actions merit based on how many people it helps 
	- our president sending unclear signals about troop locations good 
	- placebo 
	- helps to some degree 
  
  - immanuel kant d 1804 
    - hard line 
	- corrupts moral capacity and removes options of others from free will and free action 




4. three reasons why 

  - disrepects humanity and negatively affects character 
  - transgression against divine law 
  - lying about one things means lying about other things

#### disrepects humanity and negatively affects character, but 

1. judas' telling of the truth is generally considered a great evil 




2. lying to protect innocents from harm is almost universally praised 
3. some noble lies promote social harmony while the truth hurts it 
4. eventually, telling the truth will clash with equall cherished values 
  - see nyberg's extended quote 


#### transgression against divine law, but
1. the bible doesnt universally condemn deception 
2. buddhist prayers and jewish texts condemn lying but allow exeptions 
3. islam: taqiya allows muslim to conseal faith to avoid persecution 
4. augustine aquinas, and catholicism all introduces loopholes
  - not all lies equally bad, some could be forgiven 
  - mental reservation telling only a partial truth 
  - equivocation: clever language that redirects listeners without techincally lying

#### lying about one things means lying about other things
1. "slippery slope" argument is simplistic at best: 
  - trump may be an exception based on his record of deception 
  - lies about private life dont necessarily turn into bad policy choices 
  - considering the person and factors associated with each situation is more prudent
2. study of children suggest that context is the key factor 
  - doctrine of speficity resulted: honesty and dishonesty as a function of the  
3. polls of adults reveal situational exemptions for deception

### answer 2: lie as a last resort (p64-65)
1. sissela bok the primary proponent (1978 book):
2. boks position is similar to absolutists in some respects: 
  - lying is generally bad for everybody
  - people lie too often and too easily
  - frequency of lying will grow unless something is done
  - trust will be destroyed and society will become more dysfunctional
  - lying is a virus that attacks human social life 
  - deception is inherently negative, truth is always preferable absent certain conditions 

  - looks at it from the receivers perspective, more about how the person would respond knowing its a lie
  - associated with voracity principle 
  - deception should be able to be justified at a later date 
  - more than just what is convenient at the time 

3. critiques 
  - nyberg: "social life without deception to keep it going is a fantasy" 
  - in any given situation, are "the truth" and what it means to tell it perfectly the same 
  - telling the truth never has to be justified? never?

### answer 3: lie when it suits your purposes 
1. judged solely from deceiver's perspective
  - "does this help or hinder me to reach my goal?"
  - "right" is always what serves the liar best

2. best captured by machiavelli in *The Prince* (1532)
  - effective leaders may use deceit but not appear deceitful
  - quintilian agreed but assumed the leaders goals/ motives were noble 

3. greene is the modern machiavelli (see quotation and fig 3.2)

4. authors critique: 
  - "high machs" see most people as gullible and weak 
  - not surptisingly, their relationships lack empathy and emotion 
  - so much for the greater good if goodness is strictly ind 

- high machs vs low machs 
- high machs think best way talk to people is to tell them what they want to hear
- high machs think people wont work hard unless forced too
- disagree that honesty is the best policy in all cases 
- disagree most people are good 

### answer 4: lying sometimes is right p70-74 
1. ethics of thruth/deception vary with each particular situation 
2. general ideas matter but context is final arbiter (e.g. during war)
3. climate of the times matters too (roosevelt vs clinton vs trump)
  - coverage of bill clinton's lies were covered very different than affairs by john kenedy or roosevelt 
4. liars motives matter 
  - the moral weight is placed on the motive behind the lie
  - could be porosocial or choice between honesty and another cherished value 
  - quite often, motives are self serving and therefore less excusable 
5. lie's consequences matter too 
  - bentham and utilitarianism: choice between lie and truth is which has greater utility 
  - placebo studies are based on this approach (spoiler alert: the placebo effect)
  - not so fast: assessing consequences can get complicated (see list, p74)

- this chapter mostly focuses on not how to lie, but instead when you might lie and what the consequences are
- main takeaway, tell the truth most of the time, your reputation matters 
- explore alternatives to lying 
- things that might be more cut and dry than being forced into a lie 
- not all deception created equal 
- anticipate getting caught, have a plan 
- golden rule 

### hard wired morality p 85 
1. the curious ( but unsolved) case of phineas gage 
  - before injury: pleasant, reliable, model employee
  - after: profane, unmreliable, untrustworthy
  - or so the legend goes: much debate around the accuracy of various accounts
  - regardless, drew attention to connection between neurobiology and behavior 
2. today: prefontal cortex may be linked to social norms and morality 
3. honesty may be a matter of both nature and nurture 

## ch.7

### intro p202 
- spotting deceitful behavior is a complicated proposition 
- there are some common manifestations under certain conditions 
- no invariable list to identifyt lying behavior in all circumstances 

### difficulties in identifying liar behavior  p202 
- determining what the observed behavior really means 
- prevalent stereotypes about how liars behave 
- competent liars alter their behavior 
- liar behavior may vary as circumstances change 
- motivations for lying may affect liar behavior 
- type of lie told may affect liar behavior 

### determining what observed behavior means p202-203
- ekman 2000: there is no sign of deceit itself
- behavior clues to deceit correspond to more than one emotion 
- anxiety, distress, anger, can be associated with truth telling 
- so are signs like delayed responses and indirect speech 
- conversly, absence of typical clues does not equate to truthfulness

### stereotypes about how liars behave 
- stereotypes prevail despite lack of evidence 
- these stereotypes are widely and consistently held (see figure 7.1)
  - stem from prescriptive (negative) social norms about deception 
  - undesirablily of lying equates to communication behaviors perceived as undesirable 
  - like memes, stereotypes are passed from group to group, reinforced via socialization 
  - also widely propogated by mass and social media 
  - primary mechanism of sterotype development is our "confirmation bias" 
- see: castillo and mallard (2012)
- see: aronson and mcglone (2008) 


### competent liars alter their behavior 
- if sure signs were discovered, effective liars would find workarounds 
- consider: 
  - despite stereotypes, poor eye contact is not typical behavior 
  - with training, one study taught techniques that reduced polygraph accuracy by 64%
  - focusijng on a broad, non deceptive goal can mitifgate individual behavioral giveaways
- but not all behaviors can be controlled by everyone all the time 
- learning to lie effectively may be analogous to learning... 
- actual leakage clues can occur accidentally revealing ...


### liar behavior can vary by circumstance p205-209
- expectations: are lies expected or a complete surprise 
  - poker game
  - vs romantic relationship 
- consequences: are the stakes high or low 
- audience: who is the target of the lie 
  - strangers vs well known 
  - one person v many 
  - targets behavior matyters, some make it easier to lie, some make it harder
  - mutual influence occurs and adaptation is par for the course 
- medium: consider distribution, synchronicity, and recorda... 

### motication may affect liar behavior p210-213
- some liars are more effective when "getting away with it" really matters 
- in same circumstances, others may suffer "motivation impairment" 
  - worrying about whether they can effectively manage their behaviors 
  - can result in failure to do so as a result of trying too hard 
- adults and children lie for similar reasons, but adult motives complex 
- TABLE ON SLIDE 
- motives drive people to deception only when the truth poses ob

### type of lie told may affect behavior p 213-215
- 2 primary types of lies: falsifying and concealing 
- misleading another type, but can occur without intent to deceive 
  - i.e., intent may not be to create false belief in targets 
  - targets may consider such behavior outright deception 
- some consistency exists among falsifying/high stakes behavior 
- lies in everyday life often a hodge-podge of all 3 types
- what tyopes of lies have been studied (see: depaulo etc)

### low-stakes lies p215-228
- lies in which **not much is gained, not much is lost**
- mostly told for one's personal benefit 
- told more commonly to people we dont know well or at all 
- some media technologies may make telling low stakes lies easier 
- low stakes lying clues may appear same as truth telling behaviors 
- everyone is an accomplished professional liar when sta...
- ekman: "most liars can fool most people most of the time"

### flattery and ingratiation p222-224 
- insincere compoliments, a "subversive masquerade" 
- it works because targets like it, may even initiate it ("am i smart?")
- ingratiators have 3 goals 
  1. locate a target who can provide benegits
  2. identify what the target needs/wants to hear 
  3. determine ways to satisfy targets needs/wants believably in ways that pay off later 
- advice from stengel (2000) and Jones (1964):
  - consider praising someone behind their back 
  - compliment or agree with supervisors while communicating lack of dependence
  - dont always agree with the target, let target see you disagree with others, etc. 

### high stakes lies p229-231
- when discovery of deception would have serious consequences 
- but undiscovered, the liar's gain is potentially considerable
- research is based on presumed presence of thse phenomena: 
  - cognitive difficulty as a result of high stakes lies being complex, harder to articulate 
  - inappropriate emotions (or affective states) used to "cover up" actual emotional state 

- generating high stakes lies for research 
  - stealing format
  - opinion format
  - cheating format


### is it the same as lying? p235-243 
- equivocation: evasive, indirect, or ambiguous language
- contexomy: isolating someone's words from original context 
- paltering: using wholly accurate statements to mislead target
- spin: making it look like something it isn't (half truths, refocusing)
- bullshit: hiding  one's **lack of concern for** truth, not truth itself 
- doublespeak: leanguage that deliberately misrepresents...
- euphemisms, jargon, bureaucratese, inflate..

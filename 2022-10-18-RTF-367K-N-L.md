- look into residencies
  - don't always need to be film residencies 

### festival retrospective
- she went to a festival last week
- talked with a lot of ppl about filmmaking
  - covid is still a thing when it comes to filmmaking esp
- big interest in korean filmmaking now 
  - continuing thing or just a short term fad
  - bc there's so many ways of getting content there's more demand for things
  - right now its really important to make quality things on a low budget 
- in all, hopeful and energized 
  - if in it to make good quality content, it's a good time 

## production 
- if done job right, could be the least creative part
- role of producer in terms of film size 
- dealing not just with crew but cast 
### first day of shoot 
- keep phone on 
- arrive early
- pitch in 
  - producer kinda sets tone on set
  - try to pitch in and be a part of everything
  - try to be a part of the production 
- set the right tone
  - will be people that worry you
  - dont panic or raise your voice
  - sounds obvious, but you need to chill out
- check in with talent
  - while AD checks in with them, you need to still meet up with them and make a good impression
  - make sure everyone is comfortable and try to help out 
  - make sure they get whats up 
- check in with director
  - see whats making them tense and try to make them comfortable as well 
- first AD
  - see how they actually operate on set
  - see whats working and not working 
  - see how to help them out 
  - no yelling
  - see what is slowing down production 
  - we need to monitor and see the big picture 
- observe closely for problems and delays 
  - need to look at the big picture 

### enemy of production 
- something out of control didnt plan for 
- changes in plans
- stay on the lookout for that 
- often there's people on set that could be down and complain 
  - need to worry about that spreading 

### lunch 
- first meal within six hours of starting is lunch 
- crew -> cast -> production staff 
  - crew will be ready to eat first 
  - cast needs get out costume
- "back on set" "back in"
  - back is when hours start back up 
- "last man"
  - 30 min after last man starts lunch 
- practice like you play 

### safety
- one of the most imp jobs of producer 
- things will happen 
- it is on the producer 
- you are responsible for every department 
- few things want think about 
  - set the right tone
    - first AD very safety conscious 
    - cpr certified
  - producer and AD get everyone together first day say things about safety 
  - keep set to 12 hours 
  - 12 hour turnaround
  - healthy meals every six hours 
  - hire right ppl right departments
    - if cant hire specialist, at least consult
  - prep film properly
  - first aid kits on set 
    - two kinds of painkiller 
      - advil and tylenol 
  - if notice something unsafe, mention in that first meeting
  - turnaround time and company moves 
- speaking up 
  - when told do something unsafe, need speak up 
  - sometimes just forget that things are unsafe 
  - if its becoming too much, need talk to someone
- equipment damage
  - hire crew who know what theyre doing 
  - hire ppl pre production days 
  - dont park cars with equipment on the street

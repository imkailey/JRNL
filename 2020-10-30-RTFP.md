## final project

### star profile
- when it says focus on an event; how broad is that?
  - pretend like interviewed them at a certain time; talk about what wouldv3e been happening/accomplished at that time
- twelve sources; only one has to be scholarly
  - current article finding skills and interpretation skills
- bibliography of no fewer than twelve sources
  - don't need to cite in the actual thing/ don't need to quote directly
- not just the interview, but also describing where and when, etc.

### annotated bibliography
- you can just keep writing
- nine sources, summary of each one
- what kinds of sources?
  - if look at the explainer; there's a breakdown
    - at least three scholarly
    - rest others; industry sources; split up between the industry mags and prof newspapers
    - could be more contemporary industry sources like modern *variety* etc.
- annotated bibliography is more of a surefire way thru this

### could talk about my past personal and political beliefs
- I'm a completely different person than I was a couple of years ago
- used to be sort of libertarian right
  - however, didn't like or believe in many issues and stuff
- as I've grown in understanding of issues and learned myself better
	- I've become more mature and less of an asshole overall
- I've changed my overall outlook on things
  - while I was trying to be a good person before my criteria for that has changes
  - I feel like overall I understand myself and the world better, along with being able to express what's going on in my head way way better
  	- things like my emotions along with my ideas
  	- toxic masculinity/emotional abuse
  - having to hide not just who I was but how I felt was torturous
  - now I can be me, in a body I don't hate, with people who care about me

I'm a different person than I was a few years ago. There's the obvious, I realized I was trans and have changed my appearance and the way I view myself drastically over the course of the last few years.
<!--  -->
However, the differences don't stop with that, I've changed my character, personality, etc. <!-- add more -->

Over time I came to the realization that I wasn't being a great person, and that I wasn't being genuine. I was hiding who I was and repressing how I felt and how I was hurting. In that space I also ended up hurting those I care about.

I wasn't a great person to be around or a great friend really, and I'm glad that now I'm a person I'm happy and proud to be. I have a lot of empathy for those who haven't been able to work on themselves as much as I have, with the wonderful support network I eventually acquired.

Sometimes I still remember a younger me hiding my emotions and lashing out, and I think there's a lot of people who are AMAB who have to deal with the societal pressure <!-- Eminem's soldier or something -->to be stoic and not cry or show emotion. A lot of AMAB people are expected to only really show aggression to others and not really be compassionate or have traits typically seen as feminine.
<!--  -->
Honestly, I love caring <!-- and... -->men, and I wish society just expected everyone to be caring and compassionate and didn't gender these traits.

<!-- (investigate this stuff) I believe -->The concept of people seen as men being forced to not show emotions is toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity isn't hating men or masculinity, it's specifically the concept that some aspects of masculinity are toxic and negative.

Not only does this suck for men, but women are often expected to do the emotional labor for men when they're in a relationship. Many men don't learn how to handle their feelings <!--and stuff -->and just dump that onto the woman they're dating. <!--when men's rights activists complain about aspects of -->

- could talk about all the different things and different racial groups I was regularly exposed to throughout my middle school high school and elementary School experience
  - when I went to St. John Paul II, I had a lot more experience with well-off White, Asian, and Hispanic students as opposed to poor people and other people of color
- in Bellville there were a lot more white and Hispanic people and not that many black people
- how could this affect my understanding of black people and black culture along with the issues that face black people in America today?

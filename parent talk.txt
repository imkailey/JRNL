- Issues with mood swings
  - extended extreme emotional changes
  - extreme highs and low
  - feeling really on top of things and excited, extreme energy and focus, extremely sociable
  - feeling extremely low, depressive, not sociable, low focus
- originally I couldn't pick out reasons for these moods, felt kind of out of nowhere
  - through mood tracking, found causes for a lot of these mood changes, often smaller things that shouldn't affect me as much as it does
- because of the dissociative issues, externally it didn't really look like I wasn't doing well
  - however, through journaling and mood tracking, it made it a little easier to understand the wider patterns of what's going on 
- I've also been having self image issues, I've been stuck seeing myself as a bad person for small things that shouldn't be issues
  - can also swing around to the other end if I'm having mood swings

# RTF addaptation paper

- you can pick any tv show except for the ones that we watched in class

### what you need to do
- background market research on the ppl that watch the show
- focus on ways you can translate/change the show to better fit for a different audience

### the paper should include
- a synopsis of the media object

Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio, originally Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, is a version of the video game Counter-Strike that was made by south korean and japanese development team, out of the popularity of the zombie gamemode in those regions. it runs on a version of the gs engine, originally made for the game Half-Life back  on November 19, 1998. this makes sense because the original game that became extremely popular in the region is the original Counter-Strike. However, it is really weird because this game was released in 2014. 

While this game is freely available in western markets on the Steam Store, the main online marketplace for games on PC, there were next to no changes made, other than a translation. Personally, I have over a thousand hours in the Counter-Strike series, and Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio was still really confusing to me. 

- an overview of the audience you are adapting to
  - keep in mind things like censorship, cost of production, cultural differences

I think that this could be a really interesting establishment for those people in the Counter-Strike community that miss the original Counter-Strike, but want a more modern everything else. It already has a store with microtransactions, a more modernized version of the server browser, and an updated UI in general. 

- how do you propose to adapt it

<!--gravelle argues that cooperative internationaism and militant interrnationonalism dont tell the full story off what is going on -->
<!--Gravelle argues for a three dimensional analysis of foreign policy. 
There's militant internationalism, cooperative internationalism, global justice, and isolationism. -->
<!--
rathbun uses shwartz's model 
(1) self-transcendence values, which emphasize the acceptance of and concern for other individuals (known and unknown), groups, society writ large, and even the global community; 
(2) self-enhancement values, which call for the pursuit of one’s own self-interest, success, satisfaction and dominance, over others if necessary; 
(3) openness values, which privilege independent feeling, thought, creativity, and action; and 
(4) conservation values, which emphasize self-restraint, social stability, resistance to change, and deference to established traditions and cultural dictates.
also, 
Conservation values provide strong predictors of militant internationalism. 
Universalism values are strongly associated with cooperative internationalism. 
Inother words, the same fundamental values that shape our
beliefs and behavior in our daily lives also predict our for-
eign-policy preferences; people take foreign policy person-
ally. Values also help us better understand the
phenomenon of isolationism. Isolationists embrace a
unique combination of personal values: they are high on
conservation but low on benevolence. Like Hurwitz and
Peffley (1987), we claim that values and foreign policy ori-
entations are related at least largely in a vertical sense, with
the former driving the latter.

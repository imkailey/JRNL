### TV makes a difference in the benefit for the hungry
- Concerts were 7 am est to around midnight
- comparing to concert for Bangladesh
  - Bangladesh Oct 1971
  - Differences are the latter on film
  - Differences in size and scope
  - Differences in number of performers and acts
- ABC and WTAF-TV (local station) covered for different portions of the day
  - ABC 3 hours of coverage with an hour pre-show
  - WTAF-TV 7 am- 6 pm
    - Contract says they can't go later
- MTV covered like c span, gavel to gavel-
  - Entire event front to back
  - Probably most extensive coverage
- It's how big it is that really impacts people
- Like being able to watch Woodstock from home
- Woodstock but more commercialized and less political explicitly?
- Demythologized Woodstock
- Original Woodstock had a few film cameras
- Changes whether people want to go or what vibe the place has
- They had big video screens at Live Aid
- Author thinks best way to enjoy Live Aid is at home
- Impressive technically and a logical extension of past innovation, but still cool direction for things to go

- Faster tape speeds for higher quality
- Mentioned something called a simulcast

## 15 Jul 1985 Pg 5

### Long on performances, short on political context
- Live Aid more nostalgic than revolutionary than Woodstock
- Very little Black representation for an event giving to Africa
- Didn't really focus on the details of what was going on, first was virtue signaling
- Current music environment did not focus on the bigger picture, who was influenced by what and who influences what
- White washed representation of what rock was
- Focused more on the spectacle of what was going on
  - Should have focused on how to get the aid there
  - Should have shown more what it was going to
  - Should have focused on more diversity
- Woodstock used politics to help change the world
  - Live Aid thought if you throw enough money at a problem it will go away
- Very very little focus on the actual cause raising money for
  - Mostly a focus on changing the world and on the music
  - My dad thought it was for aids
- Mostly a cynical look at the whole event
  - From the perspective of someone who's a rock fan who feels pandered to in a bad way
  - Focused on a lot of the criticism from within communities related to this

## Live Aid Wiki

- Geldof ignored them and the **Spin** article, thinking he could still do good in the area on his own 
- wasnt an issue with Band Aid, but was with Live Aid

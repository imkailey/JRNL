  - ABC 3 hours of coverage with an hour pre-show
  - WTAF-TV 7 am- 6 pm
    - Contract says they can't go later
- MTV covered like c span, gavel to gavel-
  - Entire event front to back
  - Probably most extensive coverage
- It's how big it is that really impacts people
- Like being able to watch Woodstock from home
- Woodstock but more commercialized and less political explicitly?
- Demythologized Woodstock

## 15 Jul 1985 Pg 5
### Long on performances, short on political context
- Live aid more nostalgic than revolutionary than Woodstock
- Very little Black representation for an event giving to Africa
- Didn't really focus on the details of what was going on, first was virtue signaling
- Current music environment did not focus on the bigger picture, who was influenced by what and who influences what
- White washed representation of what rock was
- Focused more on the spectacle of what was going on
  - Should have focused on how to get the aid there
  - Should have shown more what it was going to
  - Should have focused on more diversity
- Woodstock used politics to help change the world
  - Live Aid thought if you throw enough money at a problem it will go away
- Very very little focus on the actual cause raising money for
  - Mostly a focus on changing the world and on the music
  - My dad thought it was for aids
- Mostly a cynical look at the whole event
  - From the perspective of someone who's a rock fan who feels pandered to in a bad way
  - Focused on a lot of the criticism from within communities related to this

### Live Aid vs Woodstock
- A larger focus on a cause for Live Aid
  - Sucks it didn’t really end up helping too much
  - Woodstock was way less professional

### TV makes a difference in the benefit for the hungry
- Concerts were 7 am est to around midnight
- comparing to concert for Bangladesh
  - Bangladesh Oct 1971
  - Differences are the latter on film
  - Differences in size and scope
  - Differences in number of performers and acts
- ABC and WTAF-TV (local station) covered for different portions of the day
  - ABC 3 hours of coverage with an hour pre-show
  - WTAF-TV 7 am- 6 pm
    - Contract says they can't go later
- MTV covered like c span, gavel to gavel-
  - Entire event front to back
  - Probably most extensive coverage
- It's how big it is that really impacts people
- Like being able to watch Woodstock from home
- Woodstock but more commercialized and less political explicitly?
- Demythologized Woodstock
- Original Woodstock had a few film cameras
- Changes whether people want to go or what vibe the place has
- They had big video screens at Live Aid
- Author thinks best way to enjoy Live Aid is at home
- Impressive technically and a logical extension of past innovation, but still cool direction for things to go

### Keep the music going by recording it on VCR
- An actual complete guide on specifically what tapes to use and what audio equipment to use to get the best recording on a VCR
- Faster tape speeds for higher quality
- Mentioned something called a simulcast
  - Stereo sound
- Main worry was trying to get the best edit of the tape in the future, so recording good at the time was very important

## 15 Jul 1985 Pg 5

### Long on performances, short on political context
- Live Aid more nostalgic than revolutionary than Woodstock
- Very little Black representation for an event giving to Africa
- Didn't really focus on the details of what was going on, first was virtue signaling
- Current music environment did not focus on the bigger picture, who was influenced by what and who influences what
- White washed representation of what rock was
- Focused more on the spectacle of what was going on
  - Should have focused on how to get the aid there
  - Should have shown more what it was going to
  - Should have focused on more diversity
- Woodstock used politics to help change the world
  - Live Aid thought if you throw enough money at a problem it will go away
- Very very little focus on the actual cause raising money for
  - Mostly a focus on changing the world and on the music
  - My dad thought it was for aids
- Mostly a cynical look at the whole event
  - From the perspective of someone who's a rock fan who feels pandered to in a bad way
  - Focused on a lot of the criticism from within communities related to this

## Live Aid Wiki 

### Fund use in Ethiopia
- Geldof deliberately ignored warnings from **Médecins Sans Frontières**
  - about the role of the Ethiopian Government under Derg leader **Mengistu Haile Mariam** in causing the famine and that by working with Mengistu directly
- funds from Live Aid were siphoned off to buy arms from the soviet union
  - this exacerbated existing issues
- Geldof ignored them and the **Spin** article, thinking he could still do good in the area on his own 
- wasnt an issue with Band Aid, but was with Live Aid

## 1983-1985 Famine in Ethiopia

  - Wollo 
  - Begemder

- 2.5 million people were internally displaced 
- 400,000 refugees left Ethiopia
- Almost 200,000 children were orphaned
- took place a decade into the [Ethiopian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Civil_War)
- Tofficially ascribed to drought
In recent years, the favored explanation for the famine of 1983–1985 is "war and drought"
- famines that struck Ethiopia between 1961 and 1985
  - in particular the one of 1983–1985
  - in part created by the government's military policies
    - specifically a set of so-called counter-insurgency strategies 
	  - (against Tigray People's Liberation Front guerrilla-soldiers)
	- and for "social transformation" in non-insurgent areas 
	  - (against people of Tigray Province, Wollo Province and such)
- Throughout the feudal era, 
  - famines were common in Ethiopia, 
  - especially in the north.
  - Local famines were also frequent but also unrecorded. 
- The most infamous was the "Great Ethiopian Famine" 
  - killed approximately one third of Ethiopia's population
  - (no wiki page?)
  - [1888 to 1892](https://www.cbc.ca/documentarychannel/features/ethiopias-unforgettable-famines-heres-why-they-really-happen)
    - commonly referred to as kifu qan 

### summary
- ethiopia is generally a drought stricken region
  - now as in the past this has been used as a tool of war 
- the 1983-1985 drought was made way worse due to such a tactic
  - especially in Tigray
  - along with other regions that had or could have had insurgents
- a lot of the ngos that were given resources by live aid and oxfam were in part controlled by the ethiopian government
  - didnt have the right incentives to actually feed people in the regions with civil war 

## Ethiopian Civil War

### 1970s

  - Somalia's leader Siad Barre strongly denied this by stating SNA "volunteers" were being allowed to help the WSLF

### 1980s
- The Derg in its attempt to introduce full-fledged socialist ideals
  - fulfilled its main slogan of "Land to the Tiller"
  - redistributing land in Ethiopia that once belonged to landlords to the peasants tilling the land
  - Although this was made to seem like a fair and just redistribution
    - the mismanagement
	- corruption
	- general hostility to the Derg's violent and harsh rule 
	- coupled with the draining effects of constant warfare
	- separatist guerrilla movements in Eritrea and Tigray
	- resulted in a drastic decline in general productivity of food and cash crops

### 1990s
- May 1991
- Mengistu's government was finally overthrown by 
  - its own officials 
  - a coalition of rebel forces
  - the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)
- after their bid for a push on the capital Addis Ababa became successful

### Peasant Revolution in Ethiopia 
- managed to discourage trade through commandeering both illegal and legal trade done throuhout the country
- moved a lot of shipping to part time night traffickers
- REST became a thing
  - Tigrayan releif fund stuff
  - funded by ngos abroad
  - helped get people from abroad to help overthrow the derg
    - brought attention and support from a more international crowd

### Triumph (1985–1991)
- the derg was starting to move resources from war to the famine
- the TPLF were able to weather the famine way easier and got the support of the peasants 
- by 1987 the TPLF and derg were at a stalemate

- geldof tried to paint spin as the ones who were really clueless as to what was going on instead of the other way around
  - instead didn’t address a lot of the root problems that were brought up by spin
- made it look like msf was a way larger part of the operation, but spin was in charge the entire time and simply coordinated with msf for interviews and info

## 2022-06-21 Notes from Meeting 
- look into the groups affected by the famine specifically 
- look into boy george 
- focus more on the historical events leading up to the concert
- going in the right direction 
- could get people that left ethiopia at the time's opinion on the money coming from live aid and oxfam 
- look for professors at UT that teach recent African history?

---

## Misc Notes
- there are more somalis in ethiopia than somalia (by landmass ethiopia is bigger)
- ethiopia has five national languages
- a lot of things are in the Live Aid wiki, 
  - the people that organized it

## [The Concert for Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concert_for_Bangladesh)
- pair of benefit concerts organised by former Beatles guitarist George Harrison and Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar
- Sunday, 1 August 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City
- The event was the first-ever benefit of such a magnitude
- a supergroup of performers that included Harrison, fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Leon Russell and the band Badfinger. In addition, Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan 
- a big indian music focus for some reason
- estimated $12 million had been sent to Bangladesh
- seems as though wasnt that much controvercy in where the aid went in the end
- a lot of issues getting the rights to musicians
- a lot of issues with money getting tied up in things but eventually worked out
- I see why live aid would see this and try to replicate
- feels as though more voices needed to be involved in the creation of live aid 
- reports about the show overwhelmingly positive
- relatively minimal security and minimal issues with rioting and stuff
- 200 non ticketholders got in at one point, but otherwise relatively uneventful security wise
- didnt register it as a UNISEF event beforehand, so money got held up with the IRS for a long time
- initially 2 million of aid, eventually an additional 8 million was added

### [Bob Geldof acknowledging inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concert_for_Bangladesh#/media/File:Geldofsigning.jpg)

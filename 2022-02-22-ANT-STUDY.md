# 2022-02-22-ANT-STUDY

### A few final reminders as you are studying:
- Memorize those lists from the slides in preparation for list questions
- be able to write out verbatim the definition of evolution given in lecture
- Know down to and including the family level on the handout that Dr. Lewis provided early in the semester (the table with words but no pictures). Remember that spelling counts on the exam.
- Don't forget to capitalize any genus names if you write them on the exam. If you write out a full genus and species name on the exam, don't forget to underline both words.
- Focus your studying on the lecture slides/material, but remember that there will be questions from the assigned reading on the exam. 
- On Monday, Dr. Lewis strongly hinted that she wanted you to read the genetics chapter of the textbook.

<!-- Introduce group and self -->
Hello, I'm Kailey stark, and me and my group of crack researchers; Shlomo, Zach, and Noah; have figured out the formula of success for the most popular songs of the last century! *lightning strikes* Just kidding, but we have gone through the most popular songs of the last century, cataloging everything about each one, and watching how things changed over time.
<!-- What are we doing? -->
We sorted through the top songs for each of the last ten decades to see what trends arose across a variety of factors such as beats per minute, key signature, chord progression, genre, and the socio economic and political factors of the time.
<!-- Why are we doing it?-->
Most of our group members have a background in music and looking back at what caused songs to be popular and what genres arose was a super interesting quest for us.

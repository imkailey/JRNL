### Latina feminism movement
- their understanding is feminist issues goes beyond just gender, and they help with decolonization and race issues
- needed language for their experience, and resonated heavily with blk fsts in New York
- 70s and 80s worked on theory around class and race and ethnicity
- their critique also went to ultra masculine ideas of nationalism

### borderlands/la frontera: the new mestiza
- by Gloria Andzaldúa
- an assembly of poetry and history and essays and critical anthropology
- extremely critical of people who had reactionary responses to oppression and bigotry, as taking the exact opposite response can still perpetuate the problem in a different way
- instead, she proposed a path of *conocimiento* to a "new consciousness" that could heal the split between the two mortal combatants and enable the new mestiza
- a radical reshaping of oppressor oppressed narratives that latinas adopted in their feminist theory at this point
- expanded on more in this bridge called my back
- agreed with Andzaldúa and concreted her "theory in flesh"
- Moraga observed that no authentic, non guardian connection among order groups can take place without a freaking with the source of our own oppression, without naming the enemy within ourselves and outside of ourselves
- like Andzaldúa's concientización, Moraga's theory in the flesh was at its heart a deeply political process that highlighted the relevance of personal experience to the development of theories of resistance and conversely the importance of theory for understanding "the oppressor within"
- mainstream feminism rejects this bridge called my back and the theory in the flesh
- theory in the flesh highlights the dialectical entanglement of theory and experience, foregrounding feminist theory's potential as praxis


<!-- 
### my thoughts
- I think that Latina feminism, black feminism, and other movements focused around specific intersectionalities of identity are extremely important to understanding what a specific community of people needs
- there's a lot of different groups of people with different struggles, and as long as they don't exclude everyone else from helping them I think it can be really illustrative if the need for different movements

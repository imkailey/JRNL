#### p 21
- "linguistic treadmill"
- author had issues with the way things named
  - not standardized

#### "as long as black women ... black fem will remain a important concept"
- bft is to help life intersecting oppressions
  - is work done to help others as well



#### "it is fairly obvious that if you treat things differently that are the same as treat things that are the same differently can lead to inequality"
- one way helping oppression doesn't fix everything
- not equal if all same necessarily

#### "mind of man and woman is same makes women use mind in way men don't have think about"
- is it way wired, or is it circumstance allows some people have horse blinders and others to see oppression

#### gender specific patterns racial
- whiteness as prop next week
  - economic setbacks not owning land and having generational wealth
  - that have been rooted in historic behavior and policy


#### knowing that within group; there's still different intersecting identities and that affect how they see their oppression
- but there's still similarities


#### us black fem and other social justice
- black women struggles are a part of greater struggle for justice
- if any group still oppressed; not free


#### in the end all things that are discrimination are anti-human
- normally, humnanism ia a thing white males talk aboiut; this is interesting

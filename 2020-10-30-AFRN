### Black feminist thought notes and quotes

#### pg. 21
- "linguistic treadmill"
- author had issues with the way things named
  - not standardized

#### "as long as Black women ... Black feminist will remain a important concept"
- Black Feminist Thought is to help life intersecting oppressions
  - this is work done that helps others as well

#### "it is fairly obvious that if you treat things differently that are the same as treat things that are the same differently can lead to inequality"
- one way helping oppression doesn't fix everything
- not equal if all same necessarily

#### "mind of man and woman is same makes women use mind in way men don't have think about"
- is it way wired, or is it circumstance allows some people have horse blinders and others to see oppression

#### gender specific patterns racial
- whiteness as property next week
  - economic setbacks not owning land and having generational wealth
  - that have been rooted in historic behavior and policy

#### knowing that within group; there's still different intersecting identities and that affect how they see their oppression
- but there's still similarities

#### US Black feminism and other social justice movements
- Black women struggles are a part of greater struggle for justice
- if any group still oppressed; not free

#### in the end all things that are discrimination are anti-human
- normally, humanism is a thing white males talk about; this is interesting

#### what is role of work and family when Black people economically oppressed under capitalism
- think about when watching play

#### "black women are called...."
- everybody felt able to comment on someone
- what are these stereotypes
  - without able to have a voice; how have so many others stereotyped them
- we need to combat these controlling images
- bc authority to define social roles is only given to others; they can use these symbols to keep people down.
- stereotype is to disguise your view of others; to make people feel justified in bad views
  - (isms and phobias)
- this chapter is a lot about controlling images
  - who doesn't even get shown
  - often these are dismissed; but people don't understand how this works

#### pg. 45
- government agencies affect the media produced or banned
- how artists present stuff is how the public sees it
  - what artists are hired in these spaces; how does that affect
- this chapter also talks about AIDS research

#### work of Kara Walker
- created a lot of images out of sugar to communicate stereotypes to play on them
  -very controversial

#### create responsibly
- are we creating things responsibly
- if you aren't a part of specific community; you probably shouldn't satire them
- what are the images we're portraying; what do those images

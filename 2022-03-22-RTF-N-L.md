### intro
- today is a work session
- dedicate to project 3 
- they are here to answer questions

### asking about my project 
- i also have a pretty ambitious short film idea, but in the other direction 
- pretty heavy personal topic 
- already have a shorter script and a pretty good idea of what i want it all to look like

- how do we see this character now and their choices
- how have audience know what they want 
- show a turning point

- thru screenwritign, show girl worried about finding the bra
- need to know what the top is

- show the girl is looking down at something
- show a reason that the mom goes over


- draw this out and show the uncomfort 
- do you want the characters to go into some sort of dialog 

- since the bra is such a big deal and jsut having this one thing need to show how loaded it is 
- maybe having twins or something
- 

- could see as an athlete
- could be something that obviously needs to help 
- helps to relax 
- make it seem like a natural thing

- her idea
  - some look between them like how are they going to reach
  - if does something that helps fix the mom in a knowing way, putting the bra strap away
  - could tie things together

- two domestic areas need change the feel between the two
- could be a track they run on or something
- try to put in different places
- if using two similar locations, could have one thats not jarring
- stretching out the massage and explain it in the script
- give names 
- figure out what makes the most sense for the things

- at different points in the drafting think of what you need still

- go to office hours friday

Your paper should connect "The Colored Museum" to one feminist and one performance concept covered in class. It should respond to the questions:

• What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"?

• What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any?

• How does it illuminate the lives of Black women?

• How does its aesthetics and use of dramatic form relate with (or depart from) those covered in class?

Your paper should be proofread and well-argued. Draw on specific moments or elements from the performance to corroborate your claims and connect these to specific quotes from the readings.

<!-- What is the central theme in "The Colored Museum"? -->
"The Colored Museum" was mostly about the historical and current experience of People of Color in the Unites States, with a focus on

<!-- 1 --> the links between slavery and Jim Crow laws on present day People of Color, and other racialized injustices in this country,

<!-- 2 --> how People of Color are currently treated and act in the Unites States today,

<!-- 3 --> and how People of Color are currently marginalized in the Unites States.

<!-- What kind of Black feminist intervention does "The Colored Museum" make, if any? -->
<!-- these are the feminist strategies -->
<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
<!--  -->
"The Colored Museum" presented Black women as people, without necessarily playing into stereotypes, especially for that time in media history.

<!-- these are the feminist strategies -->
<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
"The Colored Museum" tries to present the day to day lives of Black people, including women, in a light that I haven't really seen portrayed before.

<!-- this part is supposed to be about stuff like the jazz aesthetic, movement, color, etc -->
<!-- One feminist and one performance concept Black Feminist Thought has bulk of info needed fem not everyone in this bridge called my back; not everyone is Black in it there is a moment asks about Black fem specifically; you can find outside sources -->
<!-- these are the feminist strategies -->
<!-- Polyphony; Non linearity; Multiple truths; Non hierarchical relationships -->
<!-- you need to go thru and make it to where you don't need the questions there for it to make sense -->
<!--  -->
well, to begin with this performance of "The Colored Museum" was a televised one, whereas most of the other media we've consumed for this class have been readings. however, the more substantial differences start to appear when you look a bit deeper at the material of the media.
<!--  -->
one of the bigger differences is the intended audience of the works. most of the media we've consumed for this class has been for a more academic audience, without that much of an intention to entertain. this work, however, has entertainment at the front of its list of things to do.
<!--  -->
I also love the performances throughout this work. from comedic to serious to everything in between, all of the actors nailed their roles I feel. I really felt the emotion from each actor, and I didn't have a moment where a performance fell flat. considering how emotionally intense some of the scenes are, I would expect someone would give a performance that wasn't the best, however I couldn't find a time where I laughed at an actor for not pulling off a performance.

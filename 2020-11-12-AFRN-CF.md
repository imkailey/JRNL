## Review: con flama
#### By: Robert Faires

> See the bus as a gallery: each window a frame, within which is the portrait of a distinct individual, one whose features, dress, and demeanor speak to the person's specific parentage, heritage, culture, life story.
- Sharon Bridgforth?

> "grandmother smelt like sweaty stockings and day old beer. every night i climbed into a sweet sleep encased in that smell/and grandmother’s thick damp skin/big belly snores and covers."
- *Con Flama*

> The burning of that neighborhood is just one way that *Con Flama* is true to its title. Literal flames blaze in more than one of its stories, but there are also metaphorical fires – the burning of a heart with love for another, the inferno of rage.
- Robert Faires, "Review: *Con Flama*"

>  It illuminates one girl's experience, discovering her own heritage and self, but in the process it also illuminates the selves of many others, their cultures and their lineages and their struggles, in ways that often mirror the girl's.
- Robert Faires "Review: *Con Flama*"

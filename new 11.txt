### how social movements come about 
#### Piven, etc 
- social movements happen when groups dont form and lobby 
- from pluralist lens, bad and wrong 
- for marginalized groups, dont necessarily have access to officials 
  - main way engage with politics
  - way protest influenced by ways have access to officials 
- gov policies can start and quell movements 

#### morris argues 
- social movement geared to social change
- creativity impoer getting change 
- rational behavior 
- preexisting intsitutions, leaders, and orgs are opposed to social movements 

#### McAdam
- pluralism argues that theyre irrational 
  - if everyone has access, why would they protest 
- classical model
  - strcutral strain -> disruptive psychological state -> social movements 
  - focuses on individual strife
- resource model trats social movements as a rational response
- based on elites, which can be bad 
- social movements are political not purely psychological 
- based on elites, which can be bad 

#### in summary
- all of these lenses have pluses and minuses 

### mcadam political protest model

## interest and social movements
### defining interest groups
- organizations or associations of people with common interests that engages on politics ojn behalf of its members

#### types of interest groups
1. peak business associations 
1. trade associations
1. labor unions
1. farm groups 
1. professional associations 
1. voluntary membership groups 
1. civil rights and social welfare organnizations
1. corporations
1. law firms
1. intergovernmental lobby
1. coalitions
1. think tanks
1. governmental assocations

- theyre there to make sure everyone is represented in some way

#### special interests 
- schattschneider 1:38
- implication is that theyre interests shared by a small portion of the community
- exclude others and may be adverse to rest of population
- they argue that by protecting large corporations and the wealthy, you help the rest of the nation 
- groups are being formed and are working to actively educate policymakers about their interests

### theories of power 
#### democracy
- opportunities for direct democracy are really rare
- people arent necessarily the best informed
- people often dont have time to dedicate to learning about political stuff
- how we would like the world to work, however

#### elitism
- the idea that elites have all of the power or none of it
- conspiratorial
- assumption of shared goal of all of the elites, which isnt necessarily true
- fairly large group 
- just bc elites exist doesnt prove elitism 

#### pluralism [liberallism or polyarchy]
- one of the key ppl is robert doll
- groups will form and fight it out and make compromises on behalf of the people the groups represent 
- countervailing powers
  - groups are strong in some areas and weak in others 
  - non cumulative inequalities 
    - a group might be weak in one area but that doesnt mean theyll be weak somehwree else
    - the masses dont have a lot of money but can influence things at the polls
	- the financial elite are small but have a lot of money 
  - not completely true, but has a decent amount of merit
    - sometimes theres funniness afoot
	- two faces of power 
	  - private and public 
	  - power affects the optiuons people think of and are presented
	- not all groups can mobilize
	- sometimes leadership and rank in file membership dont work together
	- sometimes the groups just dont form 

### collective action problem 
- free rider problem
  - people can benefit from something the group is doing without putting any effort in 
  - this can cause the collapse of the thing everyone is putting effort into 
- more likely to pop up when dealing with public goods

#### types of goods
- public goods 
  - non rivalrous 
  - non excludable
- private goods 
  - rivalrous 
  - excludable
- club good 
  - non rivalrous 
  - excludable 
- common good 
  - rivalrous 
  - non excludable 
- harder to get ppl to organize around public goods than private ones

#### prisoners dilemma 
- suspect 1 and 2 
- either talk or not 
- best is if they dont talk 
- better for themselves if no talk 

#### spread of benefits and burdens
- if the number of actors affected by something is small, they are more likely to group up and affect change, but with a larger affected group this is less likely
- dictates incentives to mobilize or not 

### overcoming the collective action problem 
- best way is to offer incentives 
- side benefits of belonging to an organization 


#### material incentives
- tangible rewards that are things priced in monetary terms 
- can make controvertial decisions, 

#### solidarity incentives
- people want to do stuff and be a part of the organization, would feel bad if they didnt
- look better for being a part of it 
- cant make controvertial decisions, people might get disgusted and leave 

#### purposive incentives 
- tangible rewards that are derived form the sense of satisfaction of having contributed to the attainment of a worthwhile cause 
- willing to act independently of the opinion of others
- better for society as a whole but not necessarily for the benefits of the people inside 
- feel better about myself bc done something right 
- more likely to take part in controversial actions 

### lobbying
- people meeting with elected officials to express their needs
- to educate policymakers 
- classic lobbying 
- grassroots lobbying 
  - efforts on the parts of groups of associations to influence elected officials indirectly by rousing teir sconstituents 
  - calling in even if cant meet directly
- more likely to get an audience if contribute 

#### the five commandments of lobbying congress 
1. tell the truth
2. never promise more than you can deliver 
3. know how to listen so that you accurately understand what you are hearing 
4. staff are there to be worked with, not circumvented
5. spring no surprises

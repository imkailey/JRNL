a girl with multiple personalities falls in love, but her other parts don't feel the same. 

23 just out of college, going into a entry level job 

starting in a new place is really stressful and things arent going exactly how she wanted them 

this stress makes her other parts a lot more active

this ones gay boiss

she works at a gas station in her hometown 

she lives in an apartment in her hometown, real small town vibes 

gay girl walks in and becomes a regular, she recently moved back to town as well, real dommy mommy vibes 

they become flirty over time but dont really ask each out for a while

one time one of her other parts is around and doesnt flirt with her and its awkward 

theres a lot of internal conflict over whether to tell the other girl 








could use a mirror
talking to herself in the bathroom 



this girl has 3 alters including the main 
the main 
the protector/caregiver

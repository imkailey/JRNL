[Hype House and the Los Angeles TikTok Mansion Gold Rush](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html)

- a lot of "collab houses" of young influencers have been gathering at younger and younger ages

- hype house formed in dec 2019
  - 19 members
  - 4 live there full time
  - many others have rooms to crash in when in town
  - "videos including the hashtag #hypehouse have accrued nearly 100 million views on TikTok."
  - "The group handle that distributes their content surpassed three million followers on TikTok in just over a week and a half. In the days leading up to Christmas it was all anyone under the age of 18 on TikTok seemed to be talking about."

- collab houses are established tradition in influencer spaces
  - network of hubs over last five years across Los Angeles
  - 2014
    - early collab channel our second life [02l]
    - had a mansion
  - soon after
    - youtuber mansions popping up all over Los Angeles

- collab houses good for many things
  - teamwork
  - growth
  - emotional support
  - management perspective
    - helps kids focus on content
    - ew

- [my thoughts] collab houses could be bad for these reasons
  - could overwork children and young adults
  - could put extreme stress on those involved
  - could get in the way of schooling and work life balance
  - could get in way of family
  - could become exploitative very easily

- "Hype House was the brainchild of Chase Hudson, 17, a TikTok star with more than eight million followers who is known online as Lilhuddy, and Thomas Petrou, 21, a YouTube star."

- when looking for collab house, heres good things to look for
  - lots natural light
  - open space
  - far from neighbors
  - gated community ideal
  - more amenities the better
  - need to be able to film
  - possibly air bnb; long term leases arent great with fluctuations in income

[these are all quotes]
- aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus and is the home of several TikTok stars, including Bryce Hall.
- The house on Appian Way was the site of at least two large gatherings in recent weeks, police said.
- we need every resident to undertake critical safeguards to stop the spread of this virus. That includes not hosting or attending parties that put themselves, their neighbors and many others at risk,” Garcetti said
- phone call to a woman who helps manage the property, according to local residents, wasn’t immediately returned Wednesday.
- “Sway House.” The group also held a party Friday night in Encino that drew police, a source said.
- Police had twice visited the Hollywood Hills residence, first on Aug. 8 and then on Aug. 14 after complaints of noise, according to the mayor’s statement.
- A spokeswoman for Sway House declined to comment.
- Hall, who has 12.9 million TikTok followers, released a video Wednesday showing him dancing, along with another young man, to the song “Electric Love.”
- “We will restore utilities when the order is made to do so,” Department of Water and Power spokesman Joe Ramallo said.
- Rob Wilcox, a spokesman for City Atty. Mike Feuer, said the office has received a criminal investigation and is reviewing whether to charge the owner of the Appian Way party house. The home is owned by Frangipani Properties, according to public records
- Under the mayor’s directive, police officers who respond to a large party at a property can request the utilities be cut within 48 hours. Homes where parties regularly occur are the target.
- the city is considering cutting power to at least two other houses for violating coronavirus-related rules against social gatherings,
- Los Angeles police officers issued citations for noisy gatherings at 13 homes last weekend,
- Philip Enderwood, a member of the Bel Air-Beverly Crest Neighborhood Council, said the crackdown sends a message to scofflaws. “Although this is a win for the residents nearby, continued enforcement of the mayor’s directive in hillside communities will be a challenge,” he said.
- e rise in influencer houses comes amid reports of house parties at which revelers shrug off concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and ignore warnings from public health officials that gatherings help spread the virus through the community.

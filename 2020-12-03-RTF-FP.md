[Hype House and the Los Angeles TikTok Mansion Gold Rush](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html)

- a lot of "collab houses" of young influencers have been gathering at younger and younger ages

- hype house formed in dec 2019
  - 19 members
  - 4 live there full time
  - many others have rooms to crash in when in town
  - "videos including the hashtag #hypehouse have accrued nearly 100 million views on TikTok."
  - "The group handle that distributes their content surpassed three million followers on TikTok in just over a week and a half. In the days leading up to Christmas it was all anyone under the age of 18 on TikTok seemed to be talking about."

- collab houses are established tradition in influencer spaces
  - network of hubs over last five years across l.a
  - 2014
    - early collab channel our second life [02l]
    - had a mansion
  - soon after
    - youtuber mansions popping up all over la

- collab houses good for many things
  - teamwork
  - growth
  - emotional support
  - management perspective
    - helps kids focus on content
    - ew

- [my thoughts] collab houses could be bad for these reasons
  - could overwork children and young adults
  - could put extreme stress on those involved
  - could get in the way of schooling and work life balance
  - could get in way of family
  - could become exploitative very easily

- "Hype House was the brainchild of Chase Hudson, 17, a TikTok star with more than eight million followers who is known online as Lilhuddy, and Thomas Petrou, 21, a YouTube star."

- when looking for collab house, heres good things to look for
  - lots natural light
  - open space
  - far from neighbors
  - gated community ideal
  - more amenities the better
  - need to be able to film
  - possibly air bnb; long term leases arent great with fluctuations in income

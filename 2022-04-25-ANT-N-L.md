<!--talked climate change and came in late-->

###  glacial
- during glacial periods a lot of the watyer gets locked ujp in glaciers
- water recedes

###  florensiensis
- Homo erectus on florence island
- became tiny
- insular dwarfism
  - mainland animals on islands, big get small small get big
- human brain size evolution not a one way street

###  insular dwarfism
- happened twice in southease asia
- Homo luzonensis
- 67-20 KYA
- had adaptations for climbing

###  llarger implications
- somehow hominins get to those islands
- long periods of isolation
- brain evolution not one way street

###  europe
- extremely cold and frozen
- neaderthals evolved in europe
- 127-30KYA
- contemporaneos with modern humans
- brains like modern people but a bit wierder
- occipital bun
- supraorbital torus with double arched brow ridge
- suprotoral sulcus
- recede in frontal
- retromolar splace
- no bony din
- midfacial prognathism
- long, broad, prominent nose
- LIST
- big brains but
- compared to Homo sapiens, weirdly set out brain case
- long low brain case
- largely massively buile face
- robust skeleton compared to humans

###  mousterian industry
- tool from flake
- levallois
- many tools had spear points
- active hunting
- solid evidence for control of fire
  - probably created it too
  - let them live in tundra
- hunting and gathering along with spear hunting
- high frequency of fractures and healed stuff
- evidence for burying the dead

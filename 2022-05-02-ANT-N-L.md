### intro
- walked in on time, already talking about classes in biological anthropology
- slide about human variation on the board
- test is on wednesday
  - not cumulative
  - spelling matters
  - need know vocabulary from past stuff

## human variation
- only one lecture
- lok out ofr things that will be on the exam here
- last occurence of other hominins
  - ~27 KYA

### what happened to other species
- occupied similar niched and people eventually won
- competitive exclusion
- ecological species concept
  - potential for hybridization

### 2 hypotheses for human domination
- 1. out of africa
  - H. erectus evolves and spreads
  - H. sapiens evolve leave and take over
- 2. different origins and interbreeding
  - way more interbreeding and eventually become H. sapiens
- theres an answer now!
  - from genetics
  - primarily genetic material from africa
  - some interbreeding
  - some gene flow in Eurasia but not in africa

### looking in dirt
- seachign through dirt for DNA of ancient hominins
- dont even need boned
- found samples in northeast russia
- can see came from africa with minimal changes
- modern DNA of people with very little variation between people
- descended from a group of ~12,000 people that left Africa
- variation decreases as humans leave Africa

### denisova cave, Russia
- large wisdom tooth and piece of pinky bone
- could get DNA, changed our understanding of human evolution
- mandible in Tibet
- not H. sapiens, distinct from H. sapiens and Neanderthals
- Denisovans
- clear evidence of gene flow between all three of the groups

### by 100 KYA
- at least 3 different distinct region H. populations
- exchangve genes and are this 1 species
- interbreeding contributed a small portion to H. sapiens

### implications IMPORTANT
- as a species, most of our genes come from Africa ~200 KYA
- for non-africans, amount of DNA from non african late peistocene populations varies by region
- interbreeding confirmed

### gene diversity
- genetic diversity in humans is tiny
  - our species originated in africa so recently (100 KYA)
  - only small contributuion of non african populations
- race isnt clearly cut genetically
- almost all alleles common in non african populations are common in african populations
- small amount of genes not shared with africans
- genetic variation can be used to ID location
  - however, lots of migration
- race isnt biology, but inequality affects biology
<!--she also teaches sex, violence, and power-->
- a lot of phenotypical cariation
  - natural selection
  - gene flow
  - mutation
  - genetic drift
- variation with geography is always **clinal**
  - cline: variation in groups based on geography ???

### climate change is key to understnading  human evolution

### bio culutral model of human evolution
- evolutionary
- biological
- cultural

### adaptations to thermal environment
- mammals adapt to heat difference
- cultural adaptation to hot and cold
  - fire, clothing ...
- animals do this too

### phenotypic plasticity
- acclimation
  - transient morphologyt to short form stress
- acclimatization
  - permanent morphological and physiological changes in response to long term...
<!--will be a few more slides narrated-->

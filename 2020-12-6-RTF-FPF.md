Lorenz, Taylor. “Hype House and the Los Angeles TikTok Mansion Gold Rush.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 3 Jan. 2020, www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html.

A lot of “collab houses” have been forming to house young TikTok, YouTube, and twitch stars, especially in the los Angeles area. The one this article focuses on, entitled the Hype House, was formed in December of 2019. It had 19 members, with four living there full time. This was a huge success, with hashtags related to the collab house receiving 100 million views on TikTok. They also blew up soon after forming. The positives they cite for a collab house are that it’s good for teamwork, growth, emotional support, and from a management perspective can help younger influencers focus on creating content. The founder of the Hype House is Chase Hudson, 17. This article shows the ways brands are built around these houses to try to create celebrities, and by having them in one place they can curate the celebrity’s brand more.

Risky parties were happening at the Sway House during COVID-19. No one was taking precautions, and no one was tested beforehand I believe. They ended up having their utilities shut off after multiple warnings and police visits. This goes to show the lack of supervision and self-control these houses have, as they’re putting themselves in huge risk for short term gain, whether that’s socially or monetarily, as often people post videos at these parties to social media which is obviously how these people make money

This article focuses on the collapse of the Sway House due to poor management and manipulation. It doesn’t take much to become the manager of a TikTok star. These people will often sign up to the first manager they run into. Mismanagement is a huge issue in the social media business, as these people are generally teens to young adults without much business experience or guidance. As it turns out, these collab houses don’t really make all that much money on their own. Many people who start them are aiming for reality TV stardom or something similar to pay the bills. Often the real customer when it comes to these collab houses is the influencers themselves, which is very worrying considering their age a lot of the time.

Twitch streamer Fedmyster sexually assaulted/harassed fellow twitch streamers living at the OfflineTV house and used his status and his substance abuse issues as an excuse to the victims so they wouldn’t come out. Eventually, however, they did come out and break the story, and he did admit to everything that happened and fell away from streaming. This story didn’t end with this article, it kicked back up again recently due to some related drama, however it seems to have ended for good. This whole drama shows how the image of celebrities can be controlled using these houses and collaboration in general. It also shows how much abuse tactics can affect a victim’s way of viewing an event.


“TikTok Stars Charged with Misdemeanors Related to Hollywood Parties during Pandemic.” Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Times, 28 Aug. 2020, www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-28/tiktok-stars-charged-with-misdemeanors-for-huge-hollywood-parties-during-coronavirus.

Through COVID-19, it has been hard to keep these young influencers away from big parties seemingly. This is extremely annoying to everyone else who has been fighting COVID-19 19 and avoiding social gatherings. A misdemeanor charge seems low for the severity of the situation; however, the difficulty of policing COVID-19 guidelines has been a huge task. I can’t really think of things other than these huge scale influencer parties that has led to people getting charged for COVID-19 related things.

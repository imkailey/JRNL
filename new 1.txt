David and I now need to note it and make it better, since the Cards are all over the map, unfocused. But we like the show concept itself, which is basically a Below Deck Format at one of the coolest hostels in the world, in one of the most fun, beautiful places in the world.

Three things:

1] Curious what you think of the idea?

I think it looks like an interesting idea, I would watch a documentary of this. The topic is interesting and the interviewees seem interesting as well. 

2] What do you think of the execution in the Tape?

Some of the text at the beginning cuts away too fast, making it kind of hard to read. Other than that, it looks really good, but the pace of the edit feels like it goes between fast cuts and slow cuts, and the music feels like it might be changing too much. 

3] Can you please conform the script for us? Do you know what that means? It means basically making a script verbatim that matches the video. Here's a script attached from our Hulu series. Keep the boxes but delete the parts you need. I already laid out the Cards for you, see below. Please put each soundbite in its own box - and each Card in its own box - so that we can easily move boxes around. Give me a ring if you need any clarity, and here are the Cards--I already wrote them out. Call me if you need help?!

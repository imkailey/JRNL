## race and racism

### assimilation
- gradual and orderly integration of a racial or ethnic group into the dominant culture and social pattern of the U.S
- literature based on European immigrant groups
  - most conformed into white Anglo culture
- are Latinos different
- racial / ethnic bigotry makes assimilation harder but it will still happen

### segmented assimilation
- immigrant groups have different paths to assimilation
  - different socioeconomic sectors
- children of Mexican immigrants don't have same social mobility as earlier white immigrants
  - some have downward mobility
- Asian Americans encounter physical and cultural

### assimilation?
- why so many assimilation studies
- do all groups want assimilation
- who controls who adapts and what is the standard
- what's the origin of the melting pot?
  - white dominated cauldron

### how to assimilate
- does high socioeconomic status indicate assimilation?
  -  does one need to be white to assimilate
-  skin color can affect your social status

###  racial hierarchy
-  hierarchy of racialized groups involves a hierarchy of important societal resources
  -  white people have secured racial capital from this system of oppression
-  how did this hierarchy become institutionalized

###  contemporary racialization
-  racial profiling by police

###  racism without racists
-  you don't need racist people for racist systems to exist

###  hidden but embedded forms of racism
-  segregation
  -  racial residential segregation has increased
-  education
-  political underrepresentation
-  mass incarceration/criminal justice disparities
-  employment
  -  wage gap, mobility, discriminatory processes

###  four frames
-  abstract liberalism
  -  equal opportunity but abstract utilization of it
  -  equal opportunity to go against affirmative action
  -  appears reasonable and moral - civil rights w/o civil rights
-  naturalization
  -  segregation is natural - preferences biologically set
  -  that's the way things are - to explain racial phenomenon

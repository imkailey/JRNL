## poets in San Francisco
### ?
- In the late '70s there was a group of poets and writers in San Francisco that were Latino that thought for political causes
- a lot of these poets and political activists were angry at the US installing dictators in Latin America and overthrowing Democratic rule
- Issues like wealth distribution, respect for human rights, and sovereignty or issues to cultural workers like Nina Serrano
- the San Francisco political activists supported the sandinistas and the FMLN 
- this political activists were primarily cultural media people
  - these artists resonated in ways both nationally and transnationally

### the Sandinistas

  - for the freedom
  -  Nicaragua's frente de liberation nacional
  -  Nicaragua's front of national liberation
  -  San Francisco activists supported from 1972-1979
  -  were commies

- what it means to be Latino in the United States has been changed by the vast amount of central Americans that have moved to the US

- they took over some sort of Nicaraguan embassy and held it for days
- Vargas and Marguía headed down to join the fighting

 - portillo made a film about people and the Nicaraguan struggle and how San Francisco related to that
 - mixed reviews
 - didn't want to make a documentary, but the sandinistas wanted that
 - sandinistas wanted a masculine portrayal of their righteous cause

 - people from the mission became Nicaraguan ambassadors
 - many murals brought to Nicaragua
 - brought supporters of the revolution from San Francisco
 - made huge bounds in literacy

 - bravado poems, not poems of weakness

### fall of the Sandinistas

### 1. [Trans History Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history)

- Sumerian and Akkadian texts from 4500 years ago document transgender or transvestite priests known as [gala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(priests)) and by other names.


- Graves of possibly trans- or third-gender people in Europe have been identified from 4500 years ago, and likely depictions occur in art around the Mediterranean from 9000 to 3700 years ago.

- In Ancient Greece, Phrygia, and Rome, there were [galli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli) priests that some scholars believe to have been trans women, and records of women who passed as men in order to vote, fight, or study during times when these things were forbidden for women.

- Roman emperor [Elagabalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus) (d. 222) preferred to be called a lady (rather than a lord), sought sex reassignment surgery, and has been seen as an early trans figure.
  - their wiki page uses he/him grr
  - we don't know what they were gender wise necessarily; one of their wives used feminine pronouns at their request; they wore wigs, makeup, liked being called girl words
  - we don't know how true the grs claim thing is

-  [Hijras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) on the Indian subcontinent and kathoeys in Thailand have formed trans-feminine third gender social and spiritual communities since ancient times, with their presence documented for thousands of years in texts, which also mention trans male figures.

- In 1952, American trans woman [Christine Jorgensen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Jorgensen) public transition brought widespread awareness to reassignment surgery.
  - Christine often lectured on the experience of being transgender and published an autobiography in 1967.

-  In 1970s, Lou Sullivan began what became FTM International, while some feminists began to feud over excluding or including trans women.



### 2. [GRS Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery)

- The goal of early transition surgeries was the removal of hormone-producing organs (such as the testicles and the ovaries) in order to reduce their masculinizing or feminizing effects. Later, as surgical technique became more complex, the goal became to produce functional sex organs from sex organs that are already present in the patient.[citation needed]

- In the US in 1917, Dr. Alan L. Hart, an American tuberculosis specialist, became one of the first female-to-male transsexuals to undergo hysterectomy and gonadectomy for the relief of gender dysphoria.[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-6)

- In Berlin in 1931, [Dora Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorchen_Richter), became the first known transgender woman to undergo the vaginoplasty[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-7) surgical approach.

- This was followed by Lili Elbe in Dresden during 1930–1931. She started with the removal of her original sex organs, the operation supervised by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Lili went on to have four more subsequent operations that included an orchiectomy, an ovary transplant, a penectomy, and ultimately an unsuccessful uterine transplant, the rejection of which resulted in death. An earlier known recipient of this was Magnus Hirschfeld's housekeeper,[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-8) but their identity is unclear at this time.

- In 1951, Dr. Harold Gillies, a plastic surgeon active in World War II, worked to develop the first technique for female-to-male SRS, producing a technique that has become a modern standard, called phalloplasty.[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-9) Phalloplasty is a cosmetic procedure that produces a visual penis out of grafted tissue from the patient.

- Following phalloplasty, in 1999, the procedure for metoidioplasty was developed for female-to-male surgical transition by Drs. Lebovic and Laub.[10] Considered a variant of phalloplasty, metoidioplasty works to create a penis out of the patient's present clitoris. This allows the patient to have a sensation-perceiving penis head.[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-:02-10) Metoidioplasty may be used in conjunction with phalloplasty to produce a larger, more "cis-appearing" penis in multiple stages.[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-:02-10)

- On 12 June 2003, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Van Kück, a German trans woman whose insurance company denied her reimbursement for sex reassignment surgery as well as hormone replacement therapy. The legal arguments related to the Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the Article 8. This affair is referred to as Van Kück vs Germany.[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-11)

- In 2011, Christiane Völling won the first successful case brought by an intersex person against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention described by the International Commission of Jurists as "an example of an individual who was subjected to sex reassignment surgery without full knowledge or consent".[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-icj2-12)

- As of 2017, some European countries require forced sterilization for the legal recognition of sex reassignment.[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-13) As of 2020, Japan also requires the forced sterilization for that.[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-:14-14)

- The early history of sex reassignment surgery in transgender people has been reviewed by various authors. [15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-pmid4902840-15) [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery#cite_note-pmid5726922-16)

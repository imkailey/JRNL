- Graves of possibly trans- or third-gender people in Europe have been identified from 4500 years ago, and likely depictions occur in art around the Mediterranean from 9000 to 3700 years ago.

- In Ancient Greece, Phrygia, and Rome, there were [galli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli) priests that some scholars believe to have been trans women, and records of women who passed as men in order to vote, fight, or study during times when these things were forbidden for women.

- Roman emperor [Elagabalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus) (d. 222) preferred to be called a lady (rather than a lord), sought sex reassignment surgery, and has been seen as an early trans figure.

-  [Hijras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) on the Indian subcontinent and kathoeys in Thailand have formed trans-feminine third gender social and spiritual communities since ancient times, with their presence documented for thousands of years in texts, which also mention trans male figures.

- In 1952, American trans woman [Christine Jorgensen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Jorgensen) public transition brought widespread awareness to reassignment surgery.
  - Christine often lectured on the experience of being transgender and published an autobiography in 1967.

-  In 1970s, Lou Sullivan began what became FTM International, while some feminists began to feud over excluding or including trans women.

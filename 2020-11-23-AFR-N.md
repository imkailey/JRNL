### different levels of govt paintbrush analogy
- paintbrush analogy for the different levels of government such as state nation and City
- each type of government / level of government has a different size brush and a different amount of paint
- you can try to address big things with more localized government and you can make progress but that progress isn't as much as if you were doing it at a higher level of government with a larger brush
- larger levels of government can try to address smaller issues, but this can have adverse effects on different parts of the thing

### rap stuff
- polyphony is present in a lot of kendrick lamar songs
- rhythm is also a very important element obviously

### my understanding of racial issues due to my background
- I'm starting to better understand the rap music that I grew up listening to as a teenager
- could talk about all the different things and different racial groups I was regularly exposed to throughout my middle school high school and elementary School experience
  - when I went to St. John Paul II, I had a lot more experience with well-off White, Asian, and Hispanic students as opposed to poor people and other people of color
- in Bellville there were a lot more white and Hispanic people and not that many black people
- how could this affect my understanding of black people and black culture along with the issues that face black people in America today?

### could talk about my past personal and political beliefs
- I'm a completely different person than I was a couple of years ago
- used to be sort of libertarian right
  - however, didn't like or believe in many issues and stuff
- as I've grown in understanding of issues and learned myself better 
	- I've become more mature and less of an asshole overall
- ive changed my overall outlook on things 
  - while I was trying to be a good person before my criteria for that has changes 
  - I feel like overall I understand myself and the world better, along with being able to express what's going on in my head way way better 
  	- things like my emotions along with my ideas 
  	- toxic masculinity/emotional abuse 
  - having to hide not just who I was but how I felt was torturous 
  - now I have the ability to be me, in a body I dont hate, with people who care about me

---

### I feel I used to act as a bad person
- thats ok 
- I dont hate myself for that and I have understanding for people who might not have gone thru what I have/ havent figured who they are quite yet 
- being caring and understanding of those who are rude to you is important 
- empathy is key
- I wasn't evil or anything
  - just hurting and misguided and misinformed and misunderstood

---

### being nonverbal sometimes
- also there is a difference between rhythm and actual verbal words and stuff in my head which is weird

  - mouth (salivary amylase)
  - stomach (none)
  - small intestine, 
    - primary site (pancreatic amylase, maltase, sucrase, lactase)
  - large intestine (none), fermentation 
- the disaccharides and the enzymes that digest them are the same, but the enzyme hase ase at the end, disaccharide ose
- carb absorption 
  - active transporters (glucose and galactose)
  - passive (fructose)

- carb metabolism
  - glucose storage (glycogen), use for immediate energy or stored as fat
  - organ uses (brain first, others second)
  - glucose and hormone interactions: 
    - blood glucose rises 
	  - during/after meals
	  - triggers release of insulin 
	    - moves glucose out of storage to fuel the body
	  - blood glucose level is lowered
	- blood glucose falls 
	  - between meals, overnight
	  - triggers release of glucagon (hormone)
	    - moves glucose out of storage to fuel body
	  - blood glucose level is raised
- health impacts of carbs and recommended intakes for
  - simple sugars: 
    - ~15% of average daily energy intake from added, refined sugars…
    - Especially sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB)
      - Association between SSB intake and increase in body weight
      - High-fructose corn syrup: glucose + fructose
        - Used in SSB, candy, baked goods, and more!
        - Compared to table sugar (sucrose): cheap, easy to use in manufacturing, soluble, blends with other flavors, etc.
      - Increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, inflammation, hypertension
    - there's a lot more, pg 42/59

### Chapter 5
- this chapter all about oils and lipids
- important slide (12/21)
  - chart of how many saturated fats you can find in comparison to other lipids
- just because it comes from a plant doesn't mean its healthy
  - coconut oil has so much saturated fat 
  - followed by butter
- only a couple have high polyunsaturated omega 3 fatty acids
  - flaxseed oil 
  - fish oil (salmon)

- pg 12/58
- degrees of unsaturation of fats: 
  - saturated:
  - monounsaturated:
  - polyunsaturated:
  - characteristiccs and molecular structures of each
  - what hydrogenation does
  - how makes trans-fats 
- others: 
  - ~5% of dietary lipids 
  - phospholipid characteristics: 
    - Two fatty acids
      - Hydrophobic: fat soluble
    - AND phosphate group + N-containing compound (e.g. choline)
      - Phosphate group: hydrophilic: water soluble
    - Versatile: emulsifiers in food industry
    - Lecithin: best known phospholipid
      - Eggs, liver, soybeans, wheat germ, peanuts
    - Roles
      - Part of cell membranes
      - Vitamin and hormone transport in/out of cells
      - Emulsifier: keep fat suspended in blood
  - sterol characteristics:
    - Multiple-ring structure
    - Food sources
      - Cholesterol: animal sources (meat, eggs, seafood, poultry, dairy)
      - Plant sterols: structurally similar to cholesterol → interfere with cholesterol absorption → lower blood cholesterol
    - Roles of sterols
      - Vital body compounds made from cholesterol: bile acids, sex and adrenal hormones, vitamin D, cholesterol
        - 90% of body cholesterol = in cells (≠ energy)
        - Cholesterol made in the body = endogenous
        - Synthesized by liver
        - Cholesterol made outside the body (foods) = exogenous
        - Accumulation in artery walls and plaque formation = harmful
- digestigve pathways and absorption processes of lipids 
  - mouth (lipase)
  - stomach(lipase)
  - small intestine
  - primary (bile, lipases)
  - lymphatic system to circulation 
	- the only nutrient that goes directly to the lymphatic system
	- so large, need be broken down into smaller components before circulating the body
    - fat globules-> micelles-> chylomicrons-> VLDL, etc

- fat metabolism 
  - circulating (Triglycerides) TG -> (Fatty Acids) FAs
    - muscle and adipose tissue use lipoprotein lipase
	- "those circulating TGs when those FAs are broken off- they are going directly to our muscle and our adipose (fat tissue) and theyre broken down by that lipoprotein lipase ( that enzyme that breaks them down). and then in our adipose tissue itself those TGs those FAs are broken down by hormone sensitive lipase"
  - adipose TG -> FAs
    - hormone sensitive lipase 
- should know lipoprotein 
  - types
    - VLDL
	- LDL
	- HDL
	- Chylomicrons
  - **characteristics**
    - VLDL
	  - "Ferry boat" for triglycerides 
	  - deliver lipids to body cells
	  - synthesized in the liver
	- LDL
	  - associated with heart disease 
	  - delivers lipids to body cells
	- HDL
	  - Cholesterol excretion
	    - binds with cholesterol
	  - synthesized in the liver 
	- Chylomicrons
	  - "Ferry boat" for triglycerides 
	  - deliver lipids to body cells
  - health implications
    - dietary cholesterol vs blood cholesterol
    - TGs vs cholesterol

#### tangent
- if not covered much in lecture, probably not as important 
  - not much time talked about sterols
  - just the structure 
  - when started talking about cholesterol 
    - started talking about HDL, LDL, VLDL
	- should know more about those in depth
  - a lot more time talking about triglycerides than sterols

- Fatty acids: 
  - many different chain lengths of fatty acid
  - linoleic: omega 6 fatty acids: 
    - Body can synthesize other members of omega-6 family if given linoleic acid (e.g. arachidonic acid)
  - linolenic: omega 3 fatty acids: 
    - Body can synthesize other members of omega-3 family if given linolenic acid (e.g. DHA and EPA)
    - Structure and function of cells, especially in eyes and brain (growth, acuity, and development) 
    - Structure and function of cells, especially in eyes and brain (growth, acuity, and development) 
  - essential
    - cannot be synthesized in the body
	- need to be eated
  - non essential 
    - can be synthesized in the body 
  - conditionally essential 
    - might be able to be synthesized in the body depending on certain factors
- relationships between different fats and health outcomes
  - chronic disease 
    - saturated and trans fats have a higher likelihood of developing
- metabolic changes due to dietary insufficiencies
  - low carb diet 
    - gluconeogenesis

### chapter 6
- roles of protein in the body
  - main macronutrient as far as muscles and building the body are concerned
- amino acids 
  - essential: 
    - body requires
	- cannot make 
	- *essential* to derive from food 
  - non essential: 
    - body can synthesize 
	- also present in diet
	- not essential to derive from food
  - conditionally essential:
    - become essential under certain circumstances 
	- phenylalanine (essential) -> tyrosine (non essential)
	- Phenylalanine (essential) → tyrosine (nonessential)
	- Not enough phenylalanine from diet OR unable to convert (phenylketonuria) = tyrosine becomes conditionally essential
	- Newborns = only 5 nonessential amino acids (the rest are conditionally essential until the baby develops further)
- protein digestions 
  - mouth 
    - nothing
  - stomach 
    - partial hydrolysis (breakdown)
    - HCL, pepsin
	- Hydrochloric acid denatures proteins
	- Hydrochloric acid converts gastric enzyme pepsinogen (inactive ) → pepsin (active)
	- Digestive enzymes attack peptide bonds between amino acids
  - small intestine
    - further hydrolysis
    - proteases: 
	  - Pancreatic and intestinal proteases break more peptide bonds
	- peptidases: 
	  - Peptidase enzymes split most dipeptides and tripeptides into single amino acids
	  - Digestive enzymes are proteins: become denatured and digested in sub-optimal pH
- protein absorption active transporters (AAs)
- protein metabolism 
  - nitrogen balance: 
    - Zero nitrogen balance or nitrogen equilibrium
	- Balance occurs when protein synthesis = protein degradation AND when protein intake from food = nitrogen excretion
	- Positive N status: synthesis of new proteins exceeds degradation; retaining protein (and N) in tissues as blood, bone, skin, and muscle cells are built
	  - Growing infants, children, pregnant women, recovering from injury
	- Negative N status: protein degradation exceeds synthesis; losing proteins (and N) as muscle and other proteins are broken down for glucose or energy
  - amino acid pool: 
    -  released amino acids mix with dietary amino acids
	- Pattern of amino acids in pool = fairly constant, despite varying rates of protein intake and degradation
	- Used for protein production
	- Used for energy or glucose (if stripped of N)
    - Can also be stored as fat
  - urea production and excretion: 
    - Increased dietary protein intake increases urea production
- how these things work together to make up our body 


- protein deficiency
- protein and health 
  - no effects on CVD, T2D, or Cancer
  - benefits for weight management, glycemic control, appetite control, satiety, athletic performance
- protein quantities

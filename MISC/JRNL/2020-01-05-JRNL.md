It’s really early in the morning. My brain is hurting. I’ve been off my Zoloft and Adderall for a while; I’ve been dysfunctional. I need to meet with ACADV asap. I need to find out who my professors will be this next semester and reach out and get my new SSD letters. I've been dating around and beginning to look for a partner. I have had sex and have sex toys now. I have been really horny the last little while. I wish I could sleep during normal hours<!-- and ????-->. I'm hurting. I stole the film from 2 cheap disposable cameras from a goodwill. I should make an abbreviation and letter key.

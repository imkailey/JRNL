### Intro
The class this book was for is well over and done; I’ve made it to pg. 54/59? And these are my thoughts since I last wrote

---

- the thing about her not being able to read adult books for the reading thing is sad
  - seems like she used dissociation, imagination, and escapism to avoid her problems, especially as a kid

---

- the use of where the text is places is impactful on the flow and feel of the text. It’s interesting and weird how it’s used
  - the three & lined up feels good
- who is Nefertiti
- certain things in all caps; conveys tone well
- I used to live in the world; now I live in Harlem
  - this phrase is repeated a lot and hurts; universe of 6 blocks

## what I look for in organizational systems
- I choose systems based off of what I'm most comfortable with
  - google calendars and reminders and tasks
  - Amazon echo is unused
  - when it comes to note taking, I've been using a kinda similar system since 9th grade
  - I highly value backups and keeping all of my info
  - I like the simplicity in text documents, markdown is just a prettier version of that

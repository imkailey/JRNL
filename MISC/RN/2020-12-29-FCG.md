2020 12 29 FCG

these are my final notes for fcg; i finished the book finally. I dont really know how to feel about or interpret this work. I was doing my best to follow along, but in the end I just did my best to go with the flow and emotion of things.

this work, towards the end, made me remember the realization that I wont be able to have some of the more essentialist experiences of womanhood like giving birth, being a birth mother, etc

this realization alwayts hurts a lot. I just wish I had the ability to be a normal woman and also eventually be a mom. I wish i could just be a noirmal woman and expeince these things

- why am i having thwese feelings again; havent felt like this for ~a year give or take; is there something wrong with me?

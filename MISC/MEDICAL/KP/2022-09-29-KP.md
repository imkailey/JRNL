### cortosol 
- bad cortosol levels can mess with your hormone levels
  - test to see if those are too low or high 

### seroquel 
- there's a mood stableizing medication seroquel that can help with sleep issues 
- that and magnesium can help
- to her my sleep is number one priority
- at night an hour before supposed to sleep
- My therapist has an intimate knowledge of my medication and my current symptoms and wondered if a low dose of seroquel might help with my sleep issues and mood issues.

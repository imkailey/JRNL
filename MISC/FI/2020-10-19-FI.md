## emergent strategy as self help/life strategy

- your individual actions and habits and patterns affect who you are, starting small getting bigger
- that meme where thoughts lead to words lead to actions lead to character

<!--this is just the first paragraph unrefined; maybe go through and break down/elaborate-->

> After thinking about it for a bit I think I've realized why emergent strategy is probably my favorite reading so far. Thinking through what aspects of it I enjoy, it's written less like a book on theory and oppression and more like a self help book. It breaks activism and advocacy and stuff down to a more personal and manageable level, especially when you're dealing with like society wide issues. I've kinda thought through how you could also apply more the idea of emergent strategy in your daily life to help with things other than systematic things. When you break it down, bad or nuetral habits are made up of each time you do an individual task or thought. If you were to try to focus on not beating yourself up for these things, but instead doing your best to notice when you're doing something you want to change, then you can start to change yourself in the bigger picture. By using things like positive reinforcement and positive self talk, you can use the ideas in emergent strategy in your daily life to help change long standing habits and things over time.

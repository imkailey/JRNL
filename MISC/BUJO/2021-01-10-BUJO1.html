<body><h3>The State of My Bullet Journal in January of 2021</h3>
<p>
Sometime towards the end of my first semester of college I remembered I got a magnetic notebook from my mom for Christmas of 2019. It's cool; the pages are held in with a big, long magnet along the left side of the notebook. While stuff can slide around a bit, being able to move the pages around or clip them onto a clipboard is extremely helpful to me because I have really bad ADHD and it gives my anxiety to worry about putting all the pages in the right order.
</p>
<p>
I've kind of changed up the normal bullet journal layout a lot to have it work better with my brain and just how I do stuff more generally.
As of right now, here's a more general view of my system generally.
</p>
<p>
At the very beginning of the notebook when you open it up, I have my actual bullet list of what I need to do. Whenever I rewrite it or finish it, it moves back to my section of bullet journal pages that're in date order.
</p>
<p>
After that general bullet journal page, sometimes I'll have a more specific bullet journal page, something like a shopping list or a list for a specific project I'm working on. When I'm done with these, they'll go to the same section of the notebook afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I'll have the page marking the start of my 'inbox.' this is where I keep things I've written that are supposed to get typed up and put into my notes organization system on my computer. This can range from class notes to journal entries, or just random thoughts I have. Anything that ends up here will get typed up and then filed away in a section of my notebook.
</p>
<p>
After the introductory area and the inbox, I have my archive. This part doesn't necessarily stay in my magnetic notebook, as it doesn't necessarily fit even. I'm thinking about getting another one of these notebooks for my archived stuff, as its all on the pages that fit in these notebooks so I could.
</p>
<p>
There are a few different general sections that are archived here, let's go thru them all one by one again.  
There's the notes section, with subsections for my school stuff, and in there is each class. There's the misc. notes section, for notes that don't fit into the school section, with a few subsections in there too.
Getting out of the notes section, there's the bullet journal section mentioned before. Nothing really complicated here, mostly just all the bullet journal pages in date order.
The final big section is my journal section. This section is mostly made up of journal entries and is mostly unorganized, other than being in date order.
</p>
<p>
Those three main sections don't really have an order, and they change order all the time, but this final section is always at the end. It's just all the paper and it's at the very end.
</p>
<p>
Thanks, y'all, for going on this trip with me , mostly just me thinking about how I do my organization, as my classes start back up in under two weeks. This system is set up to work during times when I don't use it much and during times, I use it all the time. Right now, I haven't really been needing to use it at all, but I know I'm going to need to get back into the swing of it before long.

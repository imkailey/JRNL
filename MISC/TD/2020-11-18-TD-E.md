Lecture 21; analysis notes

- dr Woolley started his talk with talking about a nano-influencer, a person with under 5,000 followers on a given platform.
- she moved over time from a typical mom blogger to someone who was posting conspiracy theories constantly
  - this was due to how social media algorithms work
  - this is becoming a greater and greater issue; as these systems are exploitable
  - they also can allow you to get more coverage of events that can be passed over by larger media corporations

- woolley also talked about how compp propp can wrap around to larger media corpp and mess with them as well; making it harder to verify news in a world where stuff moves so quickly.

- a lot of mis/disinfoo can be spread through individual/group messaging apps in a very unseen way
  - this is what the russia stuff was about
  - relates back to naninf [nano-influencers] and "pods" [groups of naninf]

- also talked about geopropp
  - based on where you are; many things track you now so people know how tyo target uu specifically
  - very scary; look out

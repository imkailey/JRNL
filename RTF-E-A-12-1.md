I think that *She-ra and the Princesses of Power* is a really good representation of meaningful diversity in many respects, and normalizes LGBT people and relationships really well. However, they don't really show any anti LGBT sentiment or racism or anything as far as I can remember. This is a kids show so that makes sense, especially due to the fantasy and sci-fi setting. It's really nice to see a show that includes a lot of LGBT people without the baggage a more 'realistic' depiction would have.

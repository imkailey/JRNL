### oldest definite fossil primate:

  - adapods
  - omoyoids

#### what know about
1. def primates
  - grasping hands and feet, nails, postorbital bar
2. probably evilved in SE Asia and migrated to other holarctic continents
3. 2 groups initially adapppoinds and omoyoids
- evolved right after PETM
- grooming claw and derived tarsal features mean maybe a strpsirrhine ancestor
- omoyoids maybe tarsier relatives

- primates in trponcs must have survived this...

### sanhang china 
- cave site 45 mya eocene

---

### eosimias 
- 90-180g
- first anthropoid 
- not know if postorbital structure 
- teeth and mandible like orthrop
- tarsal synapomorphies

### in afro arobia 37-29 mya
- earliest fossil lorises and bush babies

### late eocene
- latopithecus
- 2 premolars
- fearloes catirrhine 
- teeth suggest frugivory but eating leaves for protein

### early oligocene 
- aegyptopithecus 
- 2 premolar leatrrhine
- less molar sharing
- arborial anadoped 

---

- two names of species 
- **underline genus name when writing**

---

- so cut'arrhie split between cercopithecoids and hominoids occured in atro rabia during the oligocene 

- ANOTHER SLIDE ON PHONE

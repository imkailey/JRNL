## stats

- trying to figure out what we're measuring 

### signal and noise
- data = signal and noise
- signal = what trying measure
- noise = error/variation
  - in our measurement
  - in our sample

- *if noise random; as sample size increases, noise decreases*

### the elusive "average" 
- mean - arithmetic av
- media - halfway point 
- mode - most common answer

- **you want to pay attention to all three; what each is  depends heavily on the actual data; gives you a different view on each one**


### **look out for unrepresentative samples!**

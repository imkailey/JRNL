## stats
- trying to figure out what we're measuring

### signal and noise
- data = signal and noise
- signal = what trying measure
- noise = error/variation
  - in our measurement
  - in our sample
- *if noise random; as sample size increases, noise decreases*

### the elusive "average"
- mean - arithmetic average
- media - halfway point
- mode - most common answer
- **you want to pay attention to all three; what each is  depends heavily on the actual data; gives you a different view on each one**

### **look out for unrepresentative samples!**





















### five basic steps involving stats in science inquiry

1. experimental design
2. data collection
  - trying to capture representative samples
3. organization and visualization
  - tables, graphs, etc.
    - we will probably be using a histograph over a bar graph
  - categorical data summarized using proportion or percent

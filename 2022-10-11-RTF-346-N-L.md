## Documentary sound
### 01 Doc Sound

#### interview vs supporting 
- dialogue/interview (DX)
  - whats the story
  - priority
  - controlled
- smth else???

#### added sound
- doc sound = forgiving but unpredictable
  - weather, crowds, no boom mic
- bad so we add = to enhance
  - SFX, backgrounds, MX
- when should you add sound?
  - fine cut, "stuck", etc

### 02 organization/mixing
<!--cameraperson doc looks good-->
- you need to organize your sound as you go forward
- in this order
  - DX (interview. dialogue, voiceover)
  - PFX (production effects)
  - SFX (sound effects)
  - BG (post bg audio)
  - MX (music, score)

#### how to mix on your own
- a good mix is 
  - balanced and clear
  - with consistent vollume
- the focus is on...
  - dialogue first
  - then built around
- you'll need 
  - good headphones (always)
  - good speakers(if available)
  - to set computer volume level ~75%
  - discipline to leave the volume alone

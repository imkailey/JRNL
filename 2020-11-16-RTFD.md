This week’s focus is on different facets of independent cinema culture. Based on our lectures and readings this week, and perhaps your own experiences, **what do you think can be done in independent or alternative media (either modern or historical) that doesn't typically fall within the boundaries of “mainstream” media?** Some subjects to consider can include production techniques and practices, storytelling, content, creative teams, distribution, etc. Also, let’s not just limit this to film: you may also want to consider television, zines, literature, art, music, streaming content, etc.

Again, you don’t have to post a written response--you can link to example(s) of any independent, alternative, or underground media that you think is relevant!

Independent films can be way more non linear than mainstream cinema. events taking place out of order or even only in the character's mind *can* be seen in some mainstream films, but the audience is still often catered to and pulled along. This also often doesn't take precedent over the audience's understanding over the work on a first watch.

Independent films also often show non literal visuals and representations of ideas and emotions that can leave an impact moreso than mainstream films I feel.

### ugly
first she just sees it as **ugly**, believing that

### menacing
as time goes on, she starts to see it as **menacing**, relate this to her captivity

over time, her isolation start having her see things, and the wallpaper is an element of this


### realizations about her abuse
she realizes the paper is actually torn at spots, big marks in the floor from furniture being moved around, but the furniture is heavy and fixed in place, wallpaper being ripped is a sign that she is seeing behind the façade of the total control of her husband, its possible to remove the wallpaper and escape. the room was probably also a nursery for young children, symbolizing she is being treated like a young child

the narrator **starts to notice a pattern** behind the main pattern of the wallpaper, but is interrupted by Johns sister; abusers often try to stop people from thinking about things

after Fourth of July with her family, watching the wallpaper becomes her primary entertainment, essentially viewing her abuse and having it take up all of her mental energy. there is a pattern behind the main pattern, a woman in a cage; narrator sees this and sees how she is forced to act over time. her husband makes light of her wanting to leave; this is more infantilization. over time, her disgusted fascination with the pattern of the wallpaper becomes more and more all consuming

### starts to be secretive so that she doesnt get in trouble
eventually the pattern of the wallpaper dominates her imagination, **but she becomes secretive about her discoveries** and doesn't want anyone else to find out that she is figuring things about her abuse. both the narrator and Jennie had touched the yellow wallpaper, and Jennie had been finding yellow stains on each of their clothes. this can be a very easy analogy to seeing similar trauma and patterns of maladaptive behaviors in people that are affected by the same abuser

John, however, can't see that her fixation is driving her more and more mad, and instead takes it for tranquility.

it starts affecting the narrators sleep, she starts smelling the wallpaper everywhere she goes, even outside. she finds a smudge mark all around the room

she sees that there is a woman in the paper trying to escape, needing to get out. the narrator thinks that Jennie and John have found her out, and that they are going to do something about her obsession.

### escaping from the paper
the narrator decides that she needs to destroy the paper to free the woman, she starts to peel the paper off all night, and finding herself alone the next day, begins to bite, claw, and tear at the paper. this is her **attempting to escape** and tear down the system of her abuse, and she starts to see herself as one of the women who have come from the paper, lashing out at her abuse.

at the end, John faints, and the narrator is free, but her abuse leaves scars on her.

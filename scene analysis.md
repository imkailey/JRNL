- I'm exploring action editing, and this scene seems to be an interesting way of going about it. 
- generally there's repeated action and fast cutting. 
- this style of editing has longer cuts during the action to hold suspense, and trying to show this as a very one sided fight. However, it still keeps up the pace while it does this. All of the action is clear and where everyone is and what they're doing is shown very well. 
- Honestly I was surprised at how long some of the shots were, because it is animated it's way easier to hold on a shot and keep on the action. 
- I really liked just how long the first shot of the planes is, it keeps the tension and still takes a while to show them. 


- this does eye trace really well, generally the focus is in the center but occassionally it will drift from one side to the other. However, it will bring you back to the center after drifting away. 
- for the rhythm, it slowly builds tension throughout the scene, and is able to keep tensions high even after all of the reveals. 
- for the 3d space, it is extremely clear where the main characters are in relation to everyone else.

#### Rock and roll's latin tinge (by d.m)
- Would get into arguments with colleague about latino influence in rock and roll
  - is it really that influntial? 
  - is it a major component in the genre?
- neither of them truely had the answer, so d.m did research
- very long list of people and albums and genres that are influenced by latino culture and music 
- generally pro immigrant sentiment, even for illegal immigrants
- he did lots of research into latino groups and music
- **other than this disagreement, were there any other reasons he did such extensive research?**
- notes the lack of literature on the topic
- talks about *The Latin Tinge* 

#### david hidalgo (wasnt he a preacher and activist?) has a squeezebox
- there used to be a huge wall in culture between latin american countries that had slavery and didnt
  - primarily because of the afro-latino influence 
- however, more recently there's been way more globalization
- the band menudo has crossed this gap
- also los lobos was getting really big at the time 
- d.m sees the promise in mexican and mexican-american music 
- ends asking them to not break up the band (probably in reference to los lobos)
  - should look into if this happened and if so to what band 
- LU: Menudo, Los Lobos

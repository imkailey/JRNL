<!--will be meeting in person wednesday-->
- point of final project to pick up on what doing in the proposal but to pivot and think about it in a different way
- will be an e-zine
- gives us bullet points how to go thru and structure it
- themes or concepts
- 3 main organizing points
- dont need to answer all of the quesiton
- finally, an introspective section looking thru and concluding your thesis
- many examples
- really consider that this isnt a thing of a research paper or all your research in a thing
- translate it into a thing that would be more interesting to read
- think about how you'd use other elements to make it interesting
- cover and back cover counted
  - not as bad as you think
- everything is due 13 May!

<!-- 1. How would you describe your experience creating with an Ensemble Company this semester? -->

Working with my group was wonderful overall. I really enjoyed talking with the people in my group about the topics we would be discussing in the work, along with going through the stylistic and narrative elements of the readings that we would implement into the work. 

It was a shame that someone had to leave our group at the last minute, especially because there was originally only three of us in the group, however I understand that these are things that cant really be planned for. I still thoroughly enjoyed my group members and the work we did together. 

Sadly, we didn't really end up writing the actual body of our work together, which was an element of online learning that couldn't really be amended without way more regular meetings. An in-person class allows for discussion at least at the beginning and end of a lecture, and being able to schedule meetings outside of class more effectively. This was another thing that wasn't really anyone's fault, but I feel with some work online classes could be a lot closer to that of an in-person class experience.

<!--2. Which feminist principles did your company employ? What did this look like in practice?-->

We ended up using 

Polyphony, multiple truths, and <!--etc; fix the order-->.

Firstly, for multiple truths I personally discussed my mental health issues that cause me to perceive the world in a very different way than I imagine most people do. Most people can remember their past; whether that's ten minutes ago or ten years ago. However, I have dissociative amnesia from my Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder) that causes me to forget trauma systematically, and my ADHD makes what's called your 'working memory' a lot smaller than neurotypical people. 

In accepting multiple truths over the course of the class, I realize that both the way I perceive the world and how others perceive the world are valid. I also learned some of the vast ways of perception that exist through some of my own research.

<!--3. Which performance strategies did your group utilize?-->

For my part of the script of the performance, I used a lot of stream of consciousness and improvisational writing in order to use Jazz Aesthetics. While improvisation is more thought of as a live performance, by essentially recording my thoughts as they occurred I could in essence record all of my thoughts in a somewhat live setting.

Also, I employed jazz aesthetics through the visuals for the piece, as I used film from a patchwork of different cameras, time periods, and manufacturers in more of a street photography setting than a studio setting. Typically, when it comes to photography, there's photos you stage and observational photos. This isn't a hard and fast line, however trying to capture things as I see them in my mind in that moment is a skill I've been trying to develop over the years, and it's starting to take shape in my more recent works. 

<!--4. What did you learn from this experience? What did you teach others?-->

I learned to ask for help and understanding from others when I start to get lost or feel overwhelmed. I often avoid reaching out of fear of feeling overbearing or incompetent or lost. I've also learned more about my past and how my past experiences affect my more subconscious thoughts. I also learned about how said experiences made me into who I am, and that I shouldn't hate the person I am now for the person I used to be.

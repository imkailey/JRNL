intro 

while this section of the bookisnt written by Frederick Douglasshimself, looking at the preface it shows that other abolitionist activists had told him it would be a good idea to express his ideas and his past into a book form, because a lot of people in the north didn't know the conditions enslaved people were subjected to. [preface author] says that Douglass lived in better conditions than many enslaved people lived in in the south, but that even then Douglass went through hell.

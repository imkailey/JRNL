### altruism
- altruistic interaction = interaction between 2 or more individuals in which the fitness of the altruist is lowered... GET REST

### the problem of altruism
- altruism is detremental to the individual but good for group

#### group selection
- members of a group of altruists have higher fitness than members of group of non altruists
- selection at level of groups of organisms, rathan individual or gene
- critiques
  - cheaters prosper in a group of altruists
  - weak form of selection 

#### kin selection 
- inclusive fitness 
- selective interaction among kin can promote the evolution of altruistic traits
- altruistic behavior will be favored by selection if the costs of performing the behavior (c) are less than the benefits (b) discounted by the coefficient of relatedness between actor and recipient (r)
  - br>c 
  - hammilton's rule
- coefficient of relatedness (r) 
  - proportion of genes shared by 2 individuals through their common descent from 1 or both parents or further back in the line
  - really only helping pretty close kin 

##### kin recognition
- there are some general rules of thumb 

#### reciprocal altruism
- definition: a series of altruistic interactions between 2 individuals in which they alternate between the roles of altruist and benificiary
- potential of cheating makes reciprocal altruism unstable but when interactions are repeated, it can be stable

### cooperative behavior is diverse

## Media adaptation paper
1. Media Object Synopsis

Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio, originally Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, is a version of the video game Counter-Strike that was made by south Korean and Japanese development team Nexon, out of the popularity of the zombie gamemodes in those regions. It runs on a version of the GoldSrc engine, originally made for the game Half-Life back  on November 19, 1998. This makes sense because the original game that became extremely popular in the region is the original Counter-Strike, which was originally a mod of Half-Life. However, it is weird because this game was released in 2014. 

While this game is freely available in western markets on the steam store, the main online marketplace for games on pc, there were next to no changes made originally, other than a translation. Personally, I have over a thousand hours in the Counter-Strike series, and Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio was still really confusing to me. 

1.1 Synopsis of the cs Competitive Gamemode
The main competitive gamemode for this game doesn’t have anything like matchmaking or a ranking system, like the newest western game in the series. Instead, it uses the server browser based approach of the games in the past. This doesn’t change the gameplay itself, but I think it does change a lot how the players engage with the game. 
The main competitive gamemode played in cs is a best of thirty, 5v5, round-based game. There are two teams, the terrorists and the counter-terrorists. The terrorists try to rush one of the two bomb sites, in order to plant the bomb. The counter terrorists play defense, trying to stop the terrorists from planting the bomb on any given site. If the terrorists are able to plant the bomb, the counter-terrorists have 40 seconds to get on that bomb site and defuse the bomb. 
At the end of each round, each team is given money based off of win status, bomb plants, kills, etc. At the beginning of the next round, each team can spend the money they earned to get better weapons, to get grenades, or to get armor.

2. Overview of Target Audience

I think that this could be a really interesting establishment for those people in the Counter-Strike community that miss the original Counter-Strike but want a more modern everything else. It already has a store with microtransactions, a more modernized version of the server browser, and an updated UI in general. It’s way better than the games of old when it comes to a lot of things UI wise, but sometimes things get cluttered and kind of confusing to me. 

2.1. Censorship

As for censorship, it was originally rated m I believe, as the games here in the united states are. I don't really see anything that would need censoring, as here in the united states games don't really need to be censored anymore.
This game is extremely similar in general content to the western version of cs, and the main difference, the focus on zombie gamemodes, doesn’t make this game more objectionable when compared to other zombie-based shooters. Games like Day Z, Seven Days to Die, and Call of Duty Zombies all are rated similarly to csns, and csns doesn’t have any content that would make it worse than those games. 

2.2. Cost of Production

For the cost it would take to produce this adaptation, I think that it would be minimal considering it already is very similar to the Counter-Strike series we have here in the united states. A lot of the changes would be things like moved around and shifted menus and tutorials. These things wouldn't require the creation of too many assets and would make it a lot easier for a huge pre-existing market to tap into this game. You could set different menu presets for different languages by default and give the end user the option to change it based on their preference and previous experience. 

3. How Do You Propose to Adapt It

When it comes to the question of how to adapt Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio, there are two main options I see. Either you make multiple versions of the game, with different versions for different markets, or you make subtle changes to tutorials for different languages and give options to change menus around to be more familiar to people coming from the western version of the game. Personally, I prefer the second option

Already this game is trying to appeal to a larger market. Originally this game was Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, but now it is Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio. This is because this game went from being a spinoff of Counter-Strike: Online, to the main Counter-Strike game that Nexon supports right now. They’ve gone from primarily zombie game modes to a wider variety of Counter-Strike gamemodes. I think you could rearrange and simplify the menu system more to appeal to a way larger audience, in both Eastern Asia and the west. 

I looked through all the studies I could find on the differences between games and audiences for first person shooters in western countries, as opposed to those for East Asian markets. I was able to find one from <!--insert source--> that was more aimed at the differences in games from Japan versus those from western game creators, primarily in America. 

One of the most interesting things about the differences, is that it is primarily one of where particular games are made, as opposed to being a difference in what is played where. There are cultural aspects that can be hugely different, for sure, but the success of East Asian video games in the past that have had minimal translation means that trying to make players feel at home in the menus should be a main worry when bringing this game here. Adding options for more traditional Counter-Strike menus for the main menu, along with for the buy menu while you are in the game, would go miles and miles to make this a more comfortable experience for people who are familiar with the western version of the game. 

I believe the cultural differences between different regions might affect what game modes become more popular in a given region. For example, whenever I find a native english speaking game of cs, it is normally the competitive, gungame, or deathmatch gamemodes. Other regions, casual matches and jailbreak servers are more common in my experience. The study I mentioned earlier says that in the Japanese games studied, you were more likely to be cooperating with other players, as opposed to the American games studied, which were more likely to be more individualistic in nature, such as deathmatch gamemodes in first person shooters. This is where I get my idea of prioritizing different gamemodes based on popularity in a region. You could set it based off of popular gamemodes in your country, based on the number of players in servers running each gamemode. This could streamline where most people want to go, and help new players feel more at home.

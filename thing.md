  - indigestible components of the diet that promote bowel movements, alleviate constipation and prevent diverticular disease
  - wheat bran, legumes, brown rice

- carbs characteristics and digestion 
  - monosaccharides: glucose, fructose, galactose
  - disaccharides: maltose, sucrose, lactose
  - polysaccharides: 
    - glycogen 
	  - stored form of glucose in the body
	- starch(amylose, amylopectin)
	  - stored form of glucose in plants
	- fiber (soluble, insoluble)
	  - provides the structure for the plants
- carb digestion: 
  - mouth (salivary amylase)
  - stomach (none)
  - small intestine, 
    - primary site (pancreatic amylase, maltase, sucrase, lactase)
  - large intestine (none), fermentation 
- the disaccharides and the enzymes that digest them are the same, but the enzyme hase ase at the end, disaccharide ose

  - passive (fructose)

- carb metabolism
  - glucose storage (glycogen), use for immediate energy or stored as fat
  - organ uses (brain first, others second)
  - glucose and hormone interactions: 
    - blood glucose rises 
	  - during/after meals
	  - triggers release of insulin 
	    - moves glucose out of storage to fuel the body
	  - blood glucose level is lowered
	- blood glucose falls 
	  - between meals, overnight
	  - triggers release of glucagon (hormone)
	    - moves glucose out of storage to fuel body
	  - blood glucose level is raised

### Chapter 5
- this chapter all about oils and lipids
- important slide (12/21)
  - chart of how many saturated fats you can find in comparison to other lipids
- just because it comes from a plant doesn't mean its healthy
  - coconut oil has so much saturated fat 
  - followed by butter
- only a couple have high polyunsaturated omega 3 fatty acids
  - flaxseed oil 
  - fish oil (salmon)

  - sterol characteristics:
- digestigve pathways and absorption processes of lipids 
  - mouth (lipase)
  - stomach(lipase)
  - small intestine
  - primary (bile, lipases)
  - lymphatic system to circulation 
	- the only nutrient that goes directly to the lymphatic system
	- so large, need be broken down into smaller components before circulating the body
    - fat globules-> micelles-> chylomicrons-> VLDL, etc

- fat metabolism 
  - circulating (Triglycerides) TG -> (Fatty Acids) FAs
    - muscle and adipose tissue use lipoprotein lipase
	- "those circulating TGs when those FAs are broken off- they are going directly to our muscle and our adipose (fat tissue) and theyre broken down by that lipoprotein lipase ( that enzyme that breaks them down). and then in our adipose tissue itself those TGs those FAs are broken down by hormone sensitive lipase"
  - adipose TG -> FAs
    - hormone sensitive lipase 
- should know lipoprotein 
  - types
    - VLDL
	- LDL
	- HDL
	- Chylomicrons
  - **characteristics**
    - VLDL
	  - "Ferry boat" for triglycerides 
	  - deliver lipids to body cells
	  - synthesized in the liver
	- LDL
	  - associated with heart disease 
	  - delivers lipids to body cells
	- HDL
	  - Cholesterol excretion
	    - binds with cholesterol
	  - synthesized in the liver 
	- Chylomicrons
	  - "Ferry boat" for triglycerides 
	  - deliver lipids to body cells
  - health implications
    - dietary cholesterol vs blood cholesterol
    - TGs vs cholesterol

#### tangent
- if not covered much in lecture, probably not as important 
  - not much time talked about sterols
  - just the structure 
  - when started talking about cholesterol 
    - started talking about HDL, LDL, VLDL
	- should know more about those in depth
  - a lot more time talking about triglycerides than sterols

- Fatty acids: 
  - many different chain lengths of fatty acid
  - linoleic: 
  - linolenic: 
  - omega 3 fatty acids: 
  - omega 6 fatty acids: 
  - essential
    - cannot be synthesized in the body
	- need to be eated
  - non essential 
    - can be synthesized in the body 
  - conditionally essential 
    - might be able to be synthesized in the body depending on certain factors
- relationships between different fats and health outcomes
  - chronic disease 
    - saturated and trans fats have a higher likelihood of developing

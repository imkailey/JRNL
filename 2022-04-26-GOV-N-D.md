## questions from watching campaigns and elections video

### differences between blanket primaries, jungle primaries, and other kinds of primaries
- blanket: you choose candidate not based on party affiliation
- similar to jungle, they put all candidates regardless of party on one ballot
- if no one gets a majority there's a runoff between the top two
- not allowed for presidential
- split within the primary might allow someone from an opposing party to actually win, there was a split in the GOP in LA and that's why they have a democratic governor
- is there a lower turnout if the candidates are from the same party? probably, if that's the only election because the candidates are similar no one cares

### primaries in each state differ, electoral rules differ, not really consistent
- its 50 separate elections on the same day (general, not primary)

### party conventions: there's a support bump, why would it decrease after?
- usually there's something weird going on because its only happened twice in the last 7 elections
- maybe there's a faux pas, or other news
- not a good sign if no bump

### nomination campaign, primaries and caucuses
- parties have been using primaries for a long time, in the before times, it was more to see how people feel, and now its to find out the representative
- you are campaigning amongst co-partisans to say "hey I'm the best person to x, z"
  - 2016: I'm the best person to carry on the legacy of Obama
  - 2020: I'm the best person to beat trump
  - in GOP primary its like who is the true conservative for the Democrats its like who is the true representative of the people
  - Mayor Pete: I can work with people from across the aisle
- internal fight for the identity of the party
  - who is the party
  - whoever wins dictates what they stand for
  - they become the face of the party
- different kinds of primaries and caucuses, why is there variation among the states
  - state tradition and federalism
  - Iowa wants to be special
  - New Hampshire does too, to be fair
  - 50 different elections, need to be aware of the different rules
  - in 2016 people said the polls were wrong, however they were right
  - Clinton won the popular vote by a slight percentage
  - state level polling wasn't as good
    - trump won states we thought Clinton would win
- media sucks at talking about the polls

### people dictate how the states will vote at the electoral college
- some states say their vote will go to whoever won the popular vote, regardless of who won in their state
- sometimes people win the popular vote, but lose the electoral college
- what do you have to change the electoral college
- the Constitution, which is not easy to change
- certain people benefit, so if they don't want to change it we all know how to work the system
- electoral college might be elitist, gives smaller groups too loud of a voice
- why campaign in states you know the outcome of, everyone spends time in battleground states
- those states kind of set the agenda
- its a tradeoff

### follow along the emotions and campaigns presentations on canvas

### emotional appeal in the campaign ads
- attempts to connect to individuals emotions
- need to understand the roles of emotions in decisions
- anger: more likely to support risky and confrontational policies
  - less attentions to the political landscape and increase reliance on partisanship and other political "habits"
  - unable to take in new information
  - rely on partisanship and stereotypes
- fear/anxiety: responding to a threat
  - less likely to support risky and confrontational policies
  - if you want to keep the status quo, fear, change is anger
- more likely to rely on new information than prior info
- ex: Colorado with a few drinks in him, be careful of bears, as he's going to sleep, he remembers the bears
    1. second floor
    2. door is locked
  - bear attack unlikely, lamp just in case
- invoke fear to get someone to switch parties
- enthusiasm: things are looking good and excited
  - beginning of this class, not now
  - reliance on political habits
  - also decreases attention to political environment
- shame: feeling of powerlessness and worthlessness, shame can lead to anger
- anger: risky behavior
- Shame: I am a bad person
- guilt: I did a bad thing
  - desires to improve future behavior, reparations
- pride: associated with an expressive impulse
  - more likely to engage in impulsive behavior
  - motivates people to post or wear political messages
  - "this is who I support"

### now emotions and political participation
- enthusiasm: high levels of low cost participation
- cost: not require a lot of effort
- enthusiasm: high levels of high cost as well
- anger: high levels of low and high cost participation
- fear: only low cost participation
- anxiety: lower levels of participation in general, worried about a threat
- fear: there's a bear right in front of me
- anxiety: I wonder if there are any bears around me
- anger is associated with increased participation for White people, but decreased participation for Black people
- for Black people enthusiasm increased turnout
- White people are used to the system working with them
- if they get angry, they want to change the system because they know they can work with it
- Black people have seen the system as being opposed to them so when things don't work out they are like "well this is just how it goes"
- first Black President used a lot of hope and change in his rhetoric
- so there is a difference when it comes to race
- when its high and low cost participation, it is just in general
- this presentation applies to White people
  - may not find the same relationship with other groups

### what the other part of the lecture that differs by race?
- the god strategy
- religious rhetoric
- taken off since the 80s with Reagan
  - god bless America started with him
- we associate the GOP with religious individuals, but White religious individuals
- as White people become more religious they are more likely to become more conservative on other issues and get closer to the GOP
- as Black people become more religious, they become more liberal on some issues and more likely to identify with Democrats
- Black religious tradition is different
- religion has taken shape on two different racial tracks
- still high levels of segregation when it comes to religious institutions
- out of the Black church, an emphasis on social justice, not as much coming from White churches
- differences in what the religion calls upon the to do
